<p class="chap">PSYCHOLOGY IN BUSINESS</p>


<p>Until the last few years the mere mention
of the word "psychology" in connection with
business was apt to be greeted with a shrug
of the shoulders, a significant raising of
the eyebrows&mdash;and a change of the subject.
Psychology was a subject that savored of the
class room, or else was thought to be somehow
concerned with the soul, or possibly related
to the abnormal phenomena generally classified
as "psychic." The average business man
was apt to impatiently resent the introduction
into business of class room topics, or speculation
regarding the soul, or of theories and
tales regarding clairvoyance, telepathy, or
general "spookiness"&mdash;for these were the
things included in his concept of "psychology."</p>

<p>But a change has come to the man in business.
He has heard much of late years re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>garding
psychology in business affairs, and
has read something on the subject. He understands
now that psychology means "the
science of the mind" and is not necessarily the
same as metaphysics or "psychism." He has
had brought home to him the fact that psychology
plays a most important part in business,
and that it is quite worth his while to
acquaint himself with its fundamental principles.
In fact, if he has thought sufficiently
on the subject, he will have seen that the entire
process of selling goods, personally, or by
means of advertising or display, is essentially
a mental process depending upon the state of
mind induced in the purchaser, and that these
states of mind are induced solely by reason
of certain established principles of psychology.
Whether the salesman, or advertiser,
realizes this or not, he is employing psychological
principles in attracting the attention,
arousing the interest, creating the desire,
and moving the will of the purchaser of his
goods.</p>

<p>The best authorities on salesmanship and
advertising now recognize this fact and emphasize
it in their writings. George French,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
in his "<i>Art and Science of Advertising</i>" says
regarding psychology in advertising: "So
we can dismiss the weird word, and simply
acknowledge that we can sell things to a man
more readily if we know the man. We can't
personally know every man to whom we wish
to sell goods. We must therefore consider if
there are not certain ways of thinking and of
acting which are common to all men, or to a
large proportion of men. If we can discover
the laws governing the action of men's minds
we will know how to appeal to those men. We
know how to appeal to Smith, because we know
Smith. We know what will please Brown, because
we know Brown. We know how to get
our way with Jones, because we know Jones.
What the advertiser must know is how to get
at Smith, Brown, and Jones without knowing
any of them. While every man has his personal
peculiarities, and while every mind has
its peculiar method of dealing with the facts
of life, every man and every mind is controlled,
in a large sense and to a great extent,
by predilections and mind-workings which
were established before he lived, and are
operated in a manner separate from his per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>sonality.
Our minds are more automatic,
more mechanical, than we are willing to admit.
That which we loosely call mind is
largely the automatic expression of tendencies
controlled by physical conditions wholly apart
from conscious intellectual or moral motives
or qualities. What those physical conditions
are, and how the knowledge of what they are
may be utilized by advertisers, forms the body
of that new knowledge some like to call psychology,
so far as it concerns advertising."
Mr. French has well expressed the idea of the
important part played in business by psychology.
What he says is, of course, as applicable
to personal salesmanship as to salesmanship
through advertisements&mdash;the same
principles are present and operative in both
cases.</p>

<p>In order to bring to the mind of the reader
the full idea of the operation of psychological
principles in the sale of goods, we shall mention
a few particular instances in which these
principles have played a part. Each reader
will be able to recollect many similar instances,
once his attention is called to the matter.</p>

<p>Prof. Halleck, a well known authority on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
psychology says: "Business men say that
the ability to gain the attention is often the
secret of success in life. Enormous salaries
are paid to persons who can write advertisements
certain to catch the eye. A publisher
said that he had sold only five thousand copies
of an excellent work, merely because it had
failed to catch the attention of many, and
that twenty-five thousand copies could have
been disposed of in the same time, if agents
had forced them upon the notice of people.
Druggists say that any kind of patent medicine
can be sold, if it is so advertised as to
strike the attention in a forcible manner.
Business life has largely resolved itself into
a battle to secure the attention of people."</p>

<p>The same excellent authority says, regarding
the effect of associated ideas: "An eminent
philosopher has said that man is completely
at the mercy of the association of his
ideas. Every new object is seen in the light
of its associated ideas. * * * The principle
of the association of ideas is sufficient to account
for the change in fashions. A woman in
a southern city had a bonnet that she particularly
admired, until she one day saw three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
negresses wearing precisely the same pattern.
She never appeared again in that bonnet.
When a style of dress becomes 'common,' and
is worn by the lower classes, it is discarded
by the fashionable people. Fashions that are
absolutely repulsive will often be adopted if
they are introduced by popular or noted
people. * * * A knowledge of the power
of the association of ideas is of the utmost
importance in business. One man has his
store so planned that all its associations are
pleasing, from the manner of the clerks to
the fixtures and drapery. Another store
brings up unpleasant associations. * * *
When negligee hats first made their appearance,
a shrewd hatter sent for a well-dressed
and popular collegian and offered him his
choice of the best hats in the store, if he would
wear a negligee hat for three days. He objected
to making such an exhibition of himself,
until he was flattered by the hatter's wager
that the hats could, in this way, be made the
fashion for the entire town. When the collegian
first put in his appearance on the
campus with the hat, he was guyed for his
oddity. Late in the afternoon, some of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
friends concluded that the hat looked so well
that they would invest. On the following day
large numbers reached the same conclusion.
For some time after this the hatter found
difficulty in keeping a sufficient supply in
stock. Had an unpopular or poorly dressed
man appeared first on the campus with that
hat, the result would have been the reverse.
The hat would have been the same, but the
association of ideas would have differed.
Some of the ladies of fashion in a large European
city selected on their own responsibility,
without consulting the milliners, a cheap
spring Manilla hat, which was very handsome.
The milliners found themselves with
a high-priced stock for which there was no
demand. They held a council, bought a large
number of the cheap hats, and put them on
the heads of all the female street sweepers and
scavengers in the town. When the ladies of
fashion went out the next day, they were
amazed to see the very dregs of the city arrayed
in headgear like their own. It was not
very long before the result was what might
have been expected."</p>

<p>In a previous work of the present writer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the following illustrations of the effect of
psychological suggestion in advertising were
used:</p>

<p>The use of the "direct command" as the
"ad. men" call it, is very common. People
are positively told to do certain things in these
advertisements. They are told to "take home
a cake of Hinky-dink's Soap tonight; your
wife needs it!" And they do it. Or they see
a mammoth hand pointing down at them from
a sign, and almost hear the corresponding
mammoth voice as it says (in painted words):
"Say you! Smoke Honey-Dope Cigars;
they're the best ever!!!" And, if you manage
to reject the command the first time, you
will probably yield at the repeated suggestion
of the same thing being hurled at you at every
corner and high fence, and "Honey-Dope"
will be your favorite brand until some other
suggestion catches you. Suggestion by authority
and repetition, remember; that's what
does the business for you! They call this
the "Direct Command" in the advertising
schools. Then there are some other subtle
forms of suggestion in advertising. You see
staring from every bit of space, on billboard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
and in newspapers and magazines: "Uwanta
Cracker," or something of that sort&mdash;and you
usually wind up by acquiescing. And then
you are constantly told that "Babies howl
for Grandma Hankin's Infantile Soother,"
and then when you hear some baby howling
you think of what you have been told they
are howling for, and then you run and buy a
bottle of "Grandma Hankin's." Then you
are told that some cigar is "Generously
Liberal" in size and quality; or that some
kind of Cocoa is "Grateful and Refreshing";
or that some brand of soap is "99.999%
Pure"; etc., etc. Only last night I saw a new
one&mdash;"Somebody's Whisky is Smooth," and
every imbiber in the car was smacking his
lips and thinking about the "smooth" feeling
in his mouth and throat. It <i>was</i> smooth&mdash;the
idea, not the stuff, I mean. And some other
whiskey man shows a picture of a glass, a
bottle, some ice and a syphon of seltzer, with
simply these words: "Oldboy's Highball&mdash;That's
all!" All of these things are suggestions,
and some of them are very powerful
ones, too, when constantly impressed upon
the mind by repetition. * * * I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
known dealers in Spring goods to force the
season by filling their windows with their advance
stock. I have seen hat dealers start up
the straw hat season by putting on a straw
themselves, their clerks ditto, and then a few
friends. The sprinkling of "straws" gave a
suggestion to the street, and the straw hat
season was opened.</p>

<p>Dr. Herbert A. Parkyn, an authority on
Suggestion, draws the following picture from
life of a retail merchant who is suffering from
the effect of adverse psychological influences
resulting from his pessimistic mental attitude.
The present writer can vouch for the
accuracy of Dr. Parkyn's picture, for he
knows the original of the sketch. Dr. Parkyn
says of the storekeeper:</p>

<p>"He is the proprietor of a store in a neighboring
city; but such a store&mdash;it almost gives
me the blues to go into it! His windows are
dressed year in and year out with the same
old signs, and there is nothing to give the
store the cheerful appearance so essential to
an up-to-date business establishment. But
the atmosphere of the place is only in keeping
with the proprietor. When he started in busi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>ness
thirty years ago he employed eight
clerks, but his business has fallen off till he
does all the work himself and is scarcely able
now to pay rent, although competitors around
him are increasing their business steadily
every year. In the course of a fifteen minute's
conversation, the first time I met him, he told
me all his troubles, which were many. According
to his story, everyone had been trying
to get the better of him ever since he
started in business; his competitors resorted
to unfair business methods; his landlord was
endeavoring to drive him out by raising his
rent; he could not get an honest clerk in his
store; an old man had not an equal chance
with a young man; he could not understand
why people he had catered to so faithfully
should be so ungrateful or so fickle as to give
their patronage to every upstart who went
into business in the same line as his; he supposed
that he could work along, as he was
doing, from morning till night without a
holiday till he was driven to the poorhouse
or died, and although he had been in the same
stand for fifteen years there was not a single
person he could call on if in need of a friend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
etc. Although I have had occasion to visit
him many times during business hours, I have
never heard him address a cheerful or encouraging
remark to a customer. On the other
hand he waited on them, not only with an air
of indifference, but apparently as if he were
doing them a favor by allowing them to trade
at his store, while others who dropped in to
ask permission to use his telephone or to enquire
about residents in the neighborhood were
soon given to understand by his manner and
answers that he considered them a nuisance
and hoped they had not mistaken his store for
an information bureau. I have purposely led
him into other channels of conversation, with
the same result; everything was going to the
dogs&mdash;the city, the country, etc. No matter
what was talked about, his remarks were saturated
with pessimism. He was ready to
blame everything and everyone for his condition,
and when I ventured to suggest that
much of his trouble was due to his attitude
he was ready to show me to the door. * * *
If he would but cast his bread upon the waters
for a few weeks by bestowing a smile here and
a smile there, or a cheerful encouraging word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
to this customer and that customer, he would
certainly feel better for the giving, and they
would return to him a thousand fold. If he
would only assume that he is prosperous and
proceed to give his store an air of prosperity,
how much more attractive he could make his
place look and how much more inviting it
would be for customers! If he would assume
that every person that entered his store was
his guest, whether he made a purchase or not,
people would feel like returning to his store
when they wanted anything in his line. I
could suggest a hundred ways in which this
man could employ suggestion and auto-suggestion
to increase his business, to draw
friends to him, instead of driving them away,
and to make the world and himself better and
happier while he lives in it."</p>

<p>But, you may ask, what has all this to do
with psychology in salesmanship&mdash;what has
the matter of advertising, store display, personal
manner, etc., to do with salesmanship?
Just this much, that all these things are based
on the same fundamental principles as is
salesmanship, and that these fundamental
principles are those of psychology. All that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
has been said refers to psychology&mdash;all is the
effect of psychology pure and simple. All
depends upon the mental attitude, the suggestions
offered, the mental states induced, the
motive to the will&mdash;all these outward things
are merely the effects of inner mental states.</p>

<p>J.W. Kennedy, in "Judicious Advertising"
says: "Advertising is just salesmanship on
paper; a mere money-making means of selling
goods rapidly. That 'mysterious something'
is just printed persuasion and its other name
is 'selling conviction.' Conviction can be imparted
at will by those few writers who have
closely studied the thought processes by which
conviction is induced. The mission of every
ad. is to convert readers into buyers." Geo.
Dyers, in the same journal says: "Advertising
takes into account the sub-conscious impressions,
the varying phases of suggestion
and association as received through the eye,
the psychology of the direct command,&mdash;all
worth earnest consideration, and seriously to
be reckoned with, however we may balk at the
terms." Seth Brown in "Salesmanship" says:
"To make advertising which will sell goods
requires development of the human part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the writer. He must realize the different
forces which command Attention, Interest,
Desire and Conviction. The buyer wants
your goods because they will produce for
him some definite effect or result. It is this
result that the ad. man must keep in mind."</p>

<p>"But," you may also say, "after all this
'psychology' seems to be nothing else than
what we have always known as 'human nature'&mdash;there
is nothing new about this."
Exactly so! Psychology is the inner science of
human nature. Human nature depends entirely
upon psychological processes&mdash;it is
bound up with the activities of the mind. The
study of human nature is the study of the
minds of people. But whereas the study of
human nature, as usually conducted, is a haphazard,
hit-or-miss sort of undertaking, the
study of the mind, according to the established
principles of psychology, is of the nature of
the study of science, and is pursued according
to scientific methods.</p>

<p>Particularly in its phase of Salesmanship
does the study of human nature along the lines
of psychology become a science. From the
first to the last Salesmanship is a psycholog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>ical
subject. Every step in the process of a
sale is a mental process. The mental attitude
and mental expression of the salesman; the
mental attitude and mental impression of the
customer; the process of arousing the attention,
awakening curiosity or interest, creating
desire, satisfying the reason, and moving the
will&mdash;all these are purely mental processes,
and the study of them becomes a branch of the
study of psychology. The display of goods on
the counters, shelves, or windows of a store,
or in the hands of the salesman on the road,
must be based upon psychological principles.
The argument of the salesman must not only
be logical but must be so arranged and worded
as to arouse certain feelings or faculties
within the mind of the prospective buyer&mdash;this
is psychology. And finally, the closing of the
sale, in which the object is to arouse the will
of the buyer into final favorable action&mdash;this
also is psychology. From the entrance of the
salesman to the final closing of the sale, each
and every step is a psychological process. A
sale is the action and reaction of mind upon
mind, according to well established psychological
principles and rules. Salesmanship is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
essentially a psychological science as all must
admit who will give to the subject a logical
consideration. To those who object to the
term "psychology" because of its newness
and unfamiliar sound, we do not care to urge
the term. Let such cling to their old term of
"human nature," remembering however that
"human nature" is essentially mental. A
dead man, a man asleep or in a trance, or an
idiot, manifests no "human nature" in the
sense the word is generally used. A man
must be alive, wide awake, and in possession
of his senses, before he is able to manifest
"human nature," and before his "human
nature" may be appealed to according to the
well known principles. "Human nature"
cannot be divorced from psychology, try as
we may.</p>

<p>We do not for a moment wish to imply that
Salesmanship is entirely dependent upon a
knowledge of psychology. There are other
factors concerned. For instance, the salesman
must possess a practical knowledge of
his goods; of the seasons; of the trend of
fashion in relation to his line; of the adaptability
of certain goods for certain sections. But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
waiving for the moment the point that even
these are concerned with the mind of people
at the last, and admitting that they may be
considered as independent of psychology, all
of these points will avail nothing if the salesman
violates the psychological principles of
the sale. Give such a man the best goods, of
the best house, with a thorough knowledge of
the requirements of the trade and the goods
themselves, and send him forth to sell those
goods. The result will be that his sales will
fall below the mark of a man far less well
equipped in other respects but who understands
the psychology of salesmanship, either
intuitively or else by conscious acquirement.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the essence of Salesmanship
is the employment of the proper psychological
principles, does it not seem imperative that
the salesman should know something of the
Mind of Man&mdash;the instrument upon which he
must play in plying his vocation? Should not
the salesman possess the same kind of knowledge
of his instrument as does the musician,
the mechanic, the artisan, the artist? What
would be thought of one who would expect to
become an expert swordsman without a knowl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>edge
of the principles of fencing, or of one
who would expect to become a boxer without
mastering the established principle of boxing?
The instruments of the salesman are his own
mind and the mind of his customers. He
should acquaint himself thoroughly with both.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="chap">THE MIND OF THE SALESMAN</p>


<p>In the Psychology of Salesmanship there
are two important elements, viz: (1) The
Mind of the Salesman; and (2) the Mind of
the Buyer. The proposition, or the goods to
be sold, constitute the connecting link between
the two Minds, or the common point upon
which the two Minds must unite, blend, and
come to agreement. The Sale itself is the
result of the fusion and agreement of the
two Minds&mdash;the product of the action and reaction
between them. Let us now proceed to
a consideration of the two important elements,
the Two Minds involved in the process of
Salesmanship.</p>

<p>Beginning our consideration of the Mind
of the Salesman, let us realize that upon his
mind depends his character and personality.
His character is composed of his individual
mental qualities or attributes. His person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>ality
is his customary outward expression of
his character. Both character and personality
may be altered, changed and improved.
And there is in each person a central <i>something</i>
which he calls "I," which is able to
order and manifest these changes in his character
and personality. While it may be
argued plausibly that a man is merely a composite
of his characteristics and nothing more,
nevertheless there is always in each the consciousness
that in his real "I" there is a
something which is above and behind characteristics,
and which may regulate the latter.
Without attempting to lead the reader into
the maze of metaphysics, or the pitfalls of
philosophy, we wish to impress upon him the
fact that his mental being has for its innermost
centre of consciousness this mysterious
"I," the nature of which no one has ever been
able to determine, but which when fully realized
imparts to one a strength and force undreamed
of before.</p>

<p>And it is well worth while for everyone
seeking self-development and self-improvement
to awaken to a clear realization of this
"I" within him, to which every faculty, every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
quality, every characteristic is an instrument
of expression and manifestation. The real
"you" is not the characteristics or features of
personality, which change from time to time,
but a permanent, changeless, centre and background
of the changes of personality&mdash;a
something that endures through all changes,
and which you simply know as "I." In the
volume of this series, entitled "<i>The New Psychology</i>,"
in the chapter entitled "The Ego,
or Self" we have spoken of this in detail.
Further mention would be out of place in the
present volume, but we may be pardoned for
quoting the following from the said chapter,
for we feel that a realization of this "I" is
most important to each person who wishes to
master his own mind, and to create his own
personality. Here follows the quotation:</p>

<p>"The consciousness of the 'I' is above personality&mdash;it
is something inseparable from
individuality. * * * The consciousness
of the 'I' is an actual experience, just as much
as is the consciousness of the page before
you. * * * The whole subject of The
New Psychology is bound up with this recognition
of the 'I'&mdash;it revolves around this 'I'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
as a wheel around its centre. We regard the
mental faculties, powers, organs, qualities,
and modes of expression, as merely instruments,
tools, or channels of expression of this
wonderful Something&mdash;the Self, the pure Ego&mdash;the
'I.' And this is the message of The
New Psychology&mdash;that You, the 'I,' have at
your command a wonderful array of mental
instruments, tools, machinery, which if properly
used will create for you any kind of personality
you may desire. You are the Master
Workman who may make of yourself what
you will. But before you can appreciate this
truth&mdash;before you can make it your own&mdash;before
you can apply it&mdash;you must enter into a
recognition and realization of this wonderful
'I' that you are, to which body and senses,
yea, even the mind itself, are but channels of
expression. You are something more than
body, or senses, or mind&mdash;you are that wonderful
Something, master of all these things,
but of which you can say but one thing: 'I
AM.'"</p>

<p>But remember, always, that this realization
of the Ego does not mean egotism, or self-conceit,
or comparison of your character or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
personality with that of others. It is Egoism
not Egotism&mdash;and Egoism means simply the
realization of this "Master-Consciousness" to
which all other mental faculties are subordinate.
If you want some other name for it, you
may consider this "I" as the "Will of the
will," for it is the very essence of <i>will-power</i>&mdash;it
is, so to speak, the Will conscious of itself.
By means of the realization, you will find it far
easier to cultivate the mental qualities in
which you are deficient, and to restrain undesirable
characteristics. The spirit of the idea
may be gained by a careful understanding of
the following from the pen of Charles F.
Lummis: "I'm all right. I am bigger than
anything that can happen to me. All these
things are outside my door, <i>and I've got the
key</i>!"</p>

<p>The mental qualities most requisite to the
Salesman may be stated as follows:</p>

<p>1. <i>Self Respect.</i> It is important to the
Salesman that he cultivate the faculty of Self
Respect. By this we do not mean egotism,
conceit, superciliousness, imperiousness, hauteur,
snobbishness, etc., all of which are detrimental
qualities. Self Respect, on the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>trary
imparts the sense of true manhood or
womanhood, self-reliance, dignity, courage
and independence. It is the spirit of Black
Hawk, the Indian chieftain, who, lifting his
head said to Jackson: "I am a Man!" It is
entirely opposed to the crawling, cringing
"worm of the dust," mental attitude of Uriah
Heep, who was continually asserting how
humble&mdash;how very humble&mdash;he was. Learn to
look the world in the eyes without flinching.
Throw off the fear of the crowd, and the impression
that you are unworthy. Learn to believe
in yourself, and to respect yourself. Let
your motto be "I Can; I Will; I Dare; I Do!"</p>

<p>Self Respect is a sure antidote for the feeling
of fear, shrinking, sense of inferiority, and
other negative feelings which sometimes oppress
the Salesman when he is about to enter
into the presence of some "big man." Remember
that the man's personality is merely
a mask, and that behind it is merely an "I"
like your own&mdash;no more, no less. Remember
that behind the "John Smith" part of you
there exists the same kind of "I" that exists
behind the "High Mucky-muck" part of him.
Remember that you are Man approaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Man&mdash;not a worm approaching a god. Remember
that just as Kipling says: "The
Colonel's lady and Judy O'Grady <i>are sisters
under their skin</i>," so are you and the big
man twin "I's" beneath the covering of personality,
position, and outward appearance.
By cultivating the realization of the "I," of
which we have told you, you will acquire a new
sense of Self Respect which will render you
immune from the feeling of bashfulness, inferiority
and fear in the presence of others.
Unless a man respects himself, he cannot expect
others to respect him. He should build
up his true individuality and respect it, being
careful, always, not to get "side-tracked" by
egotism, vanity and similar follies of personality.
It is not your personality which is entitled
to respect, but your <i>individuality</i>, which
is something far different. The personality
belongs to the outer man, the individuality to
the inner.</p>

<p>One's physical carriage and attitude tends
to react upon his own mental attitude as well
as also impressing those in whose presence he
is. There is always an action and reaction
between mind and body. Just as mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
states take form in physical actions, so do
physical actions react upon the mind and influence
mental states. Frown continually and
you will feel cross; smile and you will feel
cheerful. Carry yourself like a man, and you
will feel like a man. Carl H. Pierce says regarding
the proper carriage of a salesman:
"Remember that you are asking no favors;
that you have nothing to apologize for, and
that you have every reason in the world to
hold your head up high. And it is wonderful
what this holding of the head will do in the
way of increasing sales. We have seen salesmen
get entrance to the offices of Broadway
buyers simply through the holding of the head
straight up from the shoulders. The rule to
follow is: Have your ear lobes directly over
your shoulders, so that a plumb line hung from
the ears describes the line of your body. Be
sure not to carry the head either to the right
or left but vertical. Many men make the mistake,
especially when waiting for a prospect to
finish some important piece of business, of
leaning the head either to the right or left.
This indicates weakness. A study of men discloses
the fact that the strong men never tilt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
the head. Their heads sit perfectly straight on
strong necks. Their shoulders, held easily yet
firmly in correct position, are inspiring in
their strength indicating poise. Every line
of the body, in other words, denotes the
thought of the bearer."</p>

<p>So cultivate not only the inner sense of
Self Respect, but also the outward indications
of that mental state. Thus do you secure the
benefit of the action and reaction between
body and mind.</p>

<p>II. <i>Poise.</i> The salesman should cultivate
Poise, which manifests in balance, tranquility
and ease. Poise is that mental quality which
maintains a natural balance between the various
faculties, feelings, emotions and tendencies.
It is the assertion of the "I" as the
Master and controller of the mental states,
feelings, and action. Poise enables one to
correctly <i>balance</i> himself, mentally, instead of
allowing his feelings or emotions to run away
with him. Poise enables one to remain the
Master of Himself, instead of "slopping
over" on the one hand, or of "losing his
nerve" on the other. Poise enables one to
"keep himself well in hand." The man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
has Poise indeed has Power, for he is never
thrown off his balance, and consequently always
remains master of the situation. Did
you ever hear of, or see, the Gyroscope? Well,
it is a peculiar little mechanical contrivance
consisting of a whirling wheel within a frame
work, the peculiarity consisting of the arrangement
and action of the wheel which by
its motion always maintains its balance and
equilibrium. No matter how the little apparatus
is turned, it always maintains its
equilibrium. It is likely to play an important
part in aerial navigation and mono-rail systems
of transportation, in the future.</p>

<p>Well, here is the point&mdash;<i>be a Mental Gyroscope</i>.
Cultivate the mental quality which
acts automatically in the direction of keeping
your balance and centre of mental gravity.
This does not mean that you should be a prig,
or a solemn-faced smug bore, with an assumption
of supernatural dignity. On the contrary,
always be natural in manner and action.
The point is to always maintain your balance,
and mental control, instead of allowing your
feelings or emotions to run away with you.
Poise means Mastery&mdash;lack of it means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Slavery. As Edward Carpenter says: "How
rare indeed to meet a <i>man</i>! How common
rather to discover a creature hounded on by
tyrant thoughts (or cares, or desires), cowering,
wincing under the lash&mdash;or perchance
priding himself to run merrily in obedience
to a driver that rattles the reins and persuades
himself that he is free." Poise is the
Mental Gyroscope&mdash;keep it in good working
order.</p>

<p>III. <i>Cheerfulness.</i> The "bright, cheerful
and happy" mental attitude, and the outward
manifestation of the same, is a magnet
of success to the salesman. The "grouch"
is the negative pole of personality, and does
more to repel people than almost any other
quality. So much in demand is the cheerful
demeanor and mental state, that people often
give undue preference to those possessing it,
and pass over a "grouchy" individual of
merit in favor of the man of less merit but
who possesses the "sunshine" in his personality.
The "man with the southern exposure"
is in demand. There is enough in the world
to depress people without having gloom thrust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
upon them by persons calling to sell goods.
Well has the poet said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse quote">"Laugh, and the world laughs with you;</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Weep, and you weep alone.</div>
  <div class="verse">For this sad old earth is in need of mirth;</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">It has troubles enough of its own."</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The world prefers "Happy Jim" to
"Gloomy Gus," and will bestow its favors
upon the first while turning a cold shoulder to
the second. The Human Wet Blanket is not
a welcome guest, while the individual who
manages to "let a little sunshine in" upon all
occasions is always welcome. The optimistic
and cheerful spirit creates for itself an atmosphere
which, perhaps unconsciously, diffuses
itself in all places visited by the individual.
Cheerfulness is contagious, and is a most
valuable asset. We have known individuals
whose sunny exteriors caused a relief in the
tension on the part of those whom they
visited. We have heard it said of such people:
"I am always glad to see that fellow&mdash;he
brightens me up." This does not mean
that one should endeavor to become a professional
wit, a clown, or a comedian&mdash;that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
not the point. The idea underlying this
mental state and attribute of personality is
<i>Cheerfulness</i>, and a disposition to look on
the bright side of things, and to manifest that
mental state as the sun does its rays. Learn
to radiate Cheerfulness. It is not so much a
matter of saying things, as it is a matter of
thinking them. A man's inner thoughts are
reflected in his outward personality.</p>

<p>So cultivate the inner <i>Cheerfulness</i> before
you can hope to manifest its outer characteristics.
There is nothing so pitiful, or which
falls so flat, as a counterfeit Cheerfulness&mdash;it
is worse than the minstrel jokes of the last
decade. To be cheerful one does not have to
be a "funny man." The atmosphere of true
Cheerfulness can proceed only from within.
The higher-class Japanese instruct their children
to maintain a cheerful demeanor and a
smiling face no matter what happens, even
though the heart is breaking. They consider
this the obligation of their caste, and regard
it as most unworthy of the person, as well as
insulting to others, to manifest any other
demeanor or expression. Their theory, which
forms a part of their wonderful code called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
"Bushido," is that it is an impertinence to
obtrude one's grief, sorrow, misfortunes, or
"grouch," upon others. They reserve for
their own inner circle their sorrows and pains,
and always present a cheerful and bright appearance
to others. The Salesman would do
well to remember the "Bushido,"&mdash;he needs
it in his business. Avoid the "grouch" mental
state as you would a pestilence. Don't be a
"knocker"&mdash;for "knocks," like chickens,
come home to roost, bringing their chicks with
them.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Politeness.</i> Courtesy is a valuable
asset to a Salesman. Not only this, but it is
a trait characteristic of <i>gentlemen</i> in all walks
of life, and is a duty toward oneself as well as
toward others. By politeness and courtesy
we do not mean the formal, artificial outward
acts and remarks which are but the counterfeit
of the real thing, but, instead, that respectful
demeanor toward others which is the
mark of innate refinement and good-breeding.
Courtesy and politeness do not necessarily
consist of formal rules of etiquette, but of an
inner sympathy and understanding of others
which manifests in a courteous demeanor to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>ward
them. Everyone likes to be treated with
appreciation and understanding and is willing
to repay the same in like form. One does
not need to be a raw "jollier" in order to be
polite. Politeness&mdash;true politeness&mdash;comes
from within, and it is almost impossible to
imitate it successfully. Its spirit may be expressed
by the idea of trying to see the good
in everyone and then acting toward the person
as if his good were in plain evidence.
Give to those with whom you come in contact
the manner, attention and respect to
which they would be entitled if they were
actually manifesting the highest good within
them.</p>

<p>One of the best retail salesmen we ever
knew attributed his success to his ability to
"get on the customer's side of the counter,"
that is, to try to see the matter from the customer's
viewpoint. This led to a sympathetic
understanding which was most valuable. If
the Salesman can manage to put himself in
the place of the customer, he may see things
with a new light, and thus gain an understanding
of the customer which will enable
him, the Salesman, to manifest a true polite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>ness
toward his customers. But politeness
and courtesy does not mean a groveling, cringing
attitude of mind or demeanor. True
politeness and courtesy must have as its background
and support, Self Respect.</p>

<p>Allied to politeness is the quality called
Tact, which is defined as the "peculiar skill
or adroitness in doing or saying exactly that
which is required by, or is suited to, the circumstances;
nice perception or discernment."
A little consideration will show that Tact
must depend upon an understanding of the
viewpoint and mental attitude of the other
person, so that if one has the key to the one
he may open the door of the other. An understanding
of the other person's position, and
an application of the true spirit of politeness,
will go a long way toward establishing the
quality of tactfulness. Tact is a queer combination
of Worldly Wisdom and the Golden
Rule&mdash;a mixture of the ability to seek into the
other person's mind, and the ability to speak
unto others as you would that others speak
unto you, under the same circumstances. The
trait called Adaptability, or the faculty of
adjusting oneself to conditions, and to the per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>sonality
of others, also belongs to this category.
Adaptability depends upon the ability
to see the other person's position. As a
writer says: "Those individuals who are out
of harmony with their surroundings disappear
to make room for those who are in harmony
with them." When the keynote of the
understanding of the minds of others is found,
the whole subject of true politeness, tact and
adaptability is understood and may be applied
in practice.</p>

<p>V. <i>Human Nature.</i> Closely allied to the
subject of the preceding paragraphs, is that
of Human Nature. A knowledge of Human
Nature is very important to the Salesman.
In order to understand the workings of the
minds of others, one must not only understand
the general psychological principles involved,
but also the special manifestations of
those principles. Nature tends to form
classes and species, and the majority of people
may be grouped into special classes depending
upon their temperaments. An intelligent
study of The New Psychology and
the general subject of Human Nature in works
on Physiognomy, etc., will do much to start<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
one well upon the road to an understanding
of Human Nature. But, after all, the best
knowledge comes only when the general principles
are tested and applied under observation
in general experience.</p>

<p>In this particular work we have much to
say upon certain features of Human Nature&mdash;in
fact, as we have said, Human Nature is
but Psychology. The following advice, from
the pen of Prof. Fowler, the well known authority
on Phrenology, is recommended to all
Salesmen desirous of acquiring the faculty of
understanding Human Nature: "Scan closely
all the actions of men, with a view to ascertain
their motives and mainsprings of action;
look with a sharp eye at man, woman, child,
all you meet, as if you would read them
through; note particularly the expression of
the eye, as if you would imbibe what it
signifies; say to yourself: What faculty
prompted this expression or that action;
drink in the general looks, attitude, natural
language, and manifestation of the man, and
yield yourself to the impressions naturally
made on you&mdash;that is, study human nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
both as a philosophy and as a sentiment, or
as if being impressed thereby."</p>

<p>A forthcoming volume of this series, to be
entitled "Human Nature," will go into this
subject in detail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="chap">THE MIND OF THE SALESMAN (CONTINUED)</p>


<p>VI. <i>Hope.</i> The Salesman should cultivate
the Optimistic Outlook upon Life. He should
encourage the earnest expectation of the good
things to come, and move forward to the realization
thereof. Much of life success depends
upon the mental attitude of, and the
confident expectation of, a successful outcome.
Earnest Desire, Confident Expectation, and
Resolute Action&mdash;this is the threefold key of
attainment. Thought manifests itself in action,
and we grow in accordance with the
mental pattern or mould we create for ourselves.
If you will look around you you will
find that the men who have succeeded, and
who are succeeding, are those who have maintained
the hopeful mental attitude&mdash;who have
always looked forward to the star of hope
even in the moments of the greatest trouble
and temporary reverses. If a man loses his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
hope permanently he is defeated. Hope is
the incentive which is always drawing man
onward and upward. Hope backed by Will
and Determination is almost invincible.
Learn to look on the bright side of things, to
believe in your ultimate success. Learn to
look upward and forward&mdash;heed the motto,
"look aloft!" Cultivate the "rubber-ball
spirit," by which you will be able to bounce
higher up the harder you are thrown down.
There is a subtle psychological law by the operation
of which we tend to materialize our
ideals. The "confident expectation" backed
by actions will win out in the end. Hitch
your wagon to the Star of Hope.</p>

<p>VII. <i>Enthusiasm.</i> Very few people understand
the true meaning of the word "enthusiasm,"
although they may use it quite frequently
in ordinary conversation. Enthusiasm
means far more than energy, activity,
interest and hope&mdash;it means the expression
of the "soul" in mental and physical actions.
The Greeks used the word as meaning "inspiration;
moved by the gods," from which
arose the later meaning of "inspired by a
superhuman or divine power." The modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
usage is defined as: "Enkindled and kindling
fervor of the soul; ardent and imaginative
zeal or interest; lively manifestation of joy
or zeal;" etc. A person filled with enthusiasm
seems to move and act from the very
centre of his being&mdash;that part which we mean
when we say "soul." There is a wonderful
power in rightly directed enthusiasm, which
serves not only to arouse within one his full
powers, but also tends to impress others in
the direction of mental contagion. Mental
states are contagious, and enthusiasm is one
of the most active of mental states. Enthusiasm
comes nearer to being "soul-power" than
any other outward expression of mental
states. It is allied to the soul-stirring impulse
of music, poetry, and the drama. We can <i>feel</i>
it in the words of a writer, speaker, orator,
preacher, singer or poet. Enthusiasm may
be analyzed as Inspired Interest. As Walter
D. Moody says: "It will be found that
all men possessed of personal magnetism are
very much in earnest. Their intense earnestness
is magnetic." The best authorities agree
that Enthusiasm is the active principle of
what has been called Personal Magnetism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>An old writer has well said: "All of us
emit a sphere, aura, or halo, impregnated with
the very essence of ourselves, sensitives know
it, so do our dogs and other pets; so does a
hungry lion or tiger; aye, even flies, snakes
and insects, as we know to our cost. Some of
us are magnetic&mdash;others not. Some of us are
warm, attractive, love-inspiring and friendship-making,
while others are cold, intellectual,
thoughtful, reasoning, but not magnetic.
Let a learned man of the latter type address
an audience and it will soon tire of his intellectual
discourse, and will manifest symptoms
of drowsiness. He talks at them, but
not into them&mdash;he makes them think, not feel,
which is most tiresome to the majority of persons,
and few speakers succeed who attempt
to merely make people think&mdash;they want to
be made to feel. People will pay liberally to
be made to feel or laugh, while they will begrudge
a dime for instruction or talk that
will make them think. Pitted against a
learned man of the type mentioned above, let
there be a half-educated, but very loving, ripe
and mellow man, with but nine-tenths of the
logic and erudition of the first man, yet such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
a man carries along his crowd with perfect
ease, and everybody is wide-awake, treasuring
up every good thing that falls from his
lips. The reasons are palpable and plain. It
is heart against head; soul against logic; and
soul is bound to win every time." And as
Newman says: "Deductions have no power
of persuasion. The heart is commonly
reached, not through the reason, but through
the imagination, by means of direct impressions,
by the testimony of facts and events, by
history, by description. Persons influence
us, looks subdue us, deeds inflame us." Enthusiasm
imparts that peculiar quality that
we call "<i>life</i>," which constitutes such an important
part in the personality of a salesman.
Remember we have analyzed enthusiasm as
<i>inspired earnestness</i>&mdash;think over this analysis,
and grasp its inner meaning. The
very word "<span class="smcap">enthusiasm</span>" is inspiring&mdash;visualize
it and let it incite you to its expression
when you feel "dead." The very thought
of it is a stimulant!</p>

<p>VIII. <i>Determination.</i> The Salesman needs
the quality of dogged determination, persistence,
and "stick-to-itiveness." This bull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>dog
quality must be developed. The "I Can
and I Will" spirit must be cultivated. Determination
is composed of several constituent
faculties. First comes Combativeness or the
quality of "tackling" obstacles. This is a
marked quality in all strong characters. It
manifests as courage, boldness, resistance,
opposition, and disposition to combat opposition
rather than to yield to it.</p>

<p>Allied to this faculty is another which bears
the very inadequate name of Destructiveness,
which expresses itself in the direction of
breaking down barriers, pushing aside obstacles,
making headway; pushing to the
front; holding one's own; etc. It is the quality
of the man who makes his own paths and
builds up his own trade. It is the "pioneer"
faculty of the mind which clears away the
ground, lays foundations and builds the first
log-cabin.</p>

<p>Then comes Continuity, the faculty which
is well-defined as "stick-to-itiveness," which
enables one to stick to his task until it is finished.
This faculty gives stability and staying
qualities, and enables a man to <i>finish</i> well.
The lack of this quality often neutralizes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
work of other good faculties, causing the person
to "let go" too soon, and to thus lose the
fruits of his labors.</p>

<p>Finally, comes the faculty of Firmness,
which gives to one the quality of tenacity,
perseverance, fixity, decision and stability,
accompanied by a certain "stubborn tendency"
which holds the other faculties together.
A certain amount of this quality of
"jackass courage" is needed in the mental
make up of a Salesman. If a person is 'set' to
a certain extent it enables him to maintain his
position without the constant wear and tear
upon his will that is met with by those lacking
it. This faculty prevents one from being
"sidetracked," and enables him to "put his
hand to the plow and look not backward." It
holds the chisel of the will up against the
metal of circumstances until the work is accomplished.
It enables one to be like the rock
against which harmlessly beat the waves of
opposition and competition. It enables one
to see his object, and then to march straight
to it.</p>

<p>IX. <i>Secretiveness.</i> We mention this
quality, not because it is one which plays such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
an important part in the world of Salesmanship,
but because the tendency of the average
Salesman is to talk too freely regarding matters
which should be kept to himself. This
failing on the part of the Salesman is due to
the free expression which his work necessitates.
He should remember, however, that
many a good plan has miscarried by reason
of the tendency of the Salesman to "blab,"
or to "give away" his hopes, plans and expectations.
The Salesman should think thrice
before speaking regarding any matter of office
or personal policy, plans, methods, or
other things which he would not like his competitors
to know. It is a safe rule, laid down
by a very successful business man, that one
should "Never speak of anything that he is
not desirous of his principal competitor hearing&mdash;for
hear it he will if one speaks of it."
The world is full of the "little birds" who delight
in carrying tales&mdash;the "walls have ears"
with microphone, wireless telegraphic attachments.
Be a diplomat in matters of the kind
to which we have referred. A little thought
should convince that if you <i>yourself</i> do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
respect your own secrets, you can not expect
others to do so.</p>

<p>X. <i>Acquisitiveness.</i> This faculty manifests
as the desire for acquiring things; gaining;
possessing; reaching out for; etc. It is
often condemned by people, because of the
unpleasant traits manifested by those in
whom it is abnormally developed, as the miser,
the "hog," and the "stingy" person. But it
is not well to hastily condemn this faculty, for
without it we would become desireless, spendthrift,
wasteful, without resources, and poor.
The man who would succeed in any line of
business must cultivate Acquisitiveness, if he
is deficient in it. He must learn to want and
earnestly desire the good things of life, and
to reach out for them. He must desire to accumulate
something for himself, for by so
doing he will work so that he will make a valuable
accumulating channel for his employers.
Acquisitiveness is one of the animating principles
of the business world, evade it though we
may try to. It is hypocritical to deny this. The
facts are too plain to be brushed aside or
denied. As the writer has said in another
work: "People are all after money&mdash;every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
blessed mother's son and daughter of them&mdash;in
one way or another." What is the use of
denying it. Some day we may have better
economic conditions&mdash;I pray to God that we
may&mdash;but until that time all of us must chase
the nimble dollar to the best of our ability.
For unless a man does this thing, then shall
he not eat; nor be clothed; nor have shelter;
nor books; nor music; nor anything else that
makes life worth living for one who thinks
and feels. It seems to me the proper balance
is preserved in the following statement:
"While you're getting, get all you can&mdash;<i>but
give the other fellow a chance</i>."</p>

<p>XI. <i>Approbativeness.</i> This is the quality
which manifests in a desire for praise, flatter,
approval, fame, etc. The average Salesman
does not need to develop this faculty&mdash;his
temperament is very apt to make him have it
too highly developed. It is all very well to
feel a certain pleasure from the approval of
others of work well done. But it is a decided
weakness for one to be so sensitive to the
opinions of others that they suffer from their
disapproval, or from the lack of praise. He
who is dependent upon the praise of the crowd,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
or the approval of the mob is a fool, deserving
of pity. The crowd is fickle and tomorrow
may turn on those whom they are praising to-day.
Moreover there is always much secret
envy and jealousy mixed with the praise of
others.</p>

<p>Did you ever notice how eagerly people relate
the slip-up or stumble of those whom they
have been praising? Be not deceived by the
plaudits of the crowd. Nor should you allow
yourself to be deterred from a right course
because of fear of blame. Learn to rely on
what you, yourself, know to be right. "Be
sure you're right, then go ahead." Learn
to stand upon your own feet, and do not lean
upon others. Shake the crowd off your heels&mdash;mind
your own business and let others do
likewise. And look the world squarely in the
eye while you are talking to it, too. It will understand
you, if you do not truckle to it. But
never cringe to it&mdash;else it will rend you to
pieces. "They say; what do they say; let
them say!" "Do not worry about it&mdash;your
friends will not care, and your enemies will
criticise anyway; so what's the use?" Say to
yourself: "I am the Captain of my Soul."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
And remember Burton's glorious words of
freedom and courage:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse quote">"Do what thy manhood bids thee do, from none but self expect applause;</div>
   <div class="verse">He noblest lives and noblest dies who makes and keeps his self-made laws.</div>
   <div class="verse">All other Life is living Death, a world where none but Phantoms dwell.</div>
   <div class="verse">A breath, a wind, a sound, a voice, a tinkling of the Camel's bell."</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The difference between Egoism and Egotism
consists largely of the difference between
Self-Respect and Approbativeness. Develop
the first, and restrain the second&mdash;if you wish
to become an Individual. And the successful
Salesman is always an Individual&mdash;standing
out from and above the crowd of the "mere
persons" or "order-takers." Be a Man, and
not a human looking glass reflecting the ideas,
opinions, and wishes of all those around you.
Be creative, not imitative. Flattery is the
food for apes, not for men.</p>

<p><i>Personal Expression.</i> While one's personal
expression in the direction of clothing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
walk, voice, etc., can scarcely be called mental
qualities, yet they must be considered as <i>expressions</i>
of mental qualities&mdash;outward manifestations
of inward states. So true is this
that people naturally judge one's character by
these outward expressions. And, moreover,
there is a subtle reaction of one's outward
manifestations upon one's mental states.
One's walk, carriage and demeanor influence
one's mental attitude, as we may prove by
changing these outward manifestations and
noting our changed feelings. As someone has
said: "The consciousness of being well
dressed imparts a certain serenity and peace
which even religion sometimes fails to give
us."</p>

<p>And, as for physical attitudes, etc., hear
what several eminent psychologists tell us.
Prof. Halleck says: "By inducing an expression
we can often cause its allied emotion."
Prof. James says: "Whistling to keep up
courage is no mere figure of speech. On the
other hand, sit all day in a moping posture,
sigh, and reply to everything with a dismal
voice, and your melancholy lingers. There is
no more valuable precept in moral education<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
than this: If we wish to conquer undesirable
emotional tendencies in ourselves we must assiduously,
and in the first instance cold-bloodedly,
go through the <i>outward movements</i>, of
those contrary dispositions which we wish
to cultivate. Smooth the brow, brighten the
eye, contract the dorsal rather than the ventral
aspect of the frame, and speak in a major
key, pass the genial compliment and your
heart must indeed be frigid if it does not gradually
thaw."</p>

<p>Dr. Woods Hutchinson says: "To what extent
muscular contractions condition emotions,
as Prof. James has suggested, may be
easily tested by a quaint and simple little experiment
upon a group of the smallest voluntary
muscles of the body, those that move the
eyeball. Choose some time when you are sitting
quietly in your room, free from all disturbing
thoughts and influences. Then stand
up, and assuming an easy position, cast the
eyes upward, and hold them in that position
for thirty seconds. Instantly and involuntarily
you will be conscious of a tendency toward
reverential, devotional, contemplative
ideas and thoughts. Then turn the eyes side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>ways,
glancing directly to the right or to the
left, through half-closed lids. Within thirty
seconds images of suspicion, of uneasiness, or
of dislike will rise unbidden to the mind. Turn
the eyes on one side and slightly downward,
and suggestions of jealousy or coquetry will
be apt to spring unbidden. Direct your gaze
downward toward the floor, and you are likely
to go off into a fit of reverie or abstraction."
Maudsley says: "The specific muscular action
is not merely an exponent of passion, but truly
an essential part of it. If we try while the
features are fixed in the expression of one
passion to call up in the mind a different one,
we shall find it impossible to do so."</p>

<p>In view of the above statements, we may
readily see the importance of cultivating those
outward expressions which are co-related to
desirable mental states or feelings. By so
doing we arouse in our minds those particular
states or feelings. And, moreover, we tend to
impress others with the possession on our part
of the co-related mental qualities. One's outward
expression is a powerful instrument of
suggestion to others, and people are unconsciously
and instinctively affected by it, to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
benefit or detriment. Let us therefore consider,
briefly, the general principles underlying
personal expression along the lines indicated.</p>

<p><i>Carriage and Walk.</i> In the first part of the
previous chapter, under the sub-head of "Self-Respect"
we have given you the advice of a
good authority concerning the proper carriage.
The key is: Carry yourself in a
manner showing your Self-Respect, Poise, and
Consideration of Others. Another authority
gives the following directions for the correct
position in standing: "(1) Heels together;
(2) head up, with chin slightly drawn in rather
than protruding; (3) eyes front; (4) shoulders
thrown back but not elevated; (5) chest expanded;
(6) abdomen slightly drawn in, and
not allowed to protrude; (7) arms dropped
naturally to the sides, with the little fingers
lightly touching the sides of the thigh. This
may make you feel a little stiff and awkward
at first, but, if you persevere, will soon establish
itself as second nature with you."</p>

<p>Another authority says: "The easiest way
in which to acquire a correct carriage is to
imagine that you are suspended from on high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
with a line, the lowest end of the line being
fastened to the lower end of your breast-bone.
If you will stand and walk as if you are so
suspended, the result will be that you will
acquire an easy, graceful, gliding walk, and
a correct carriage and natural position." Another
authority gives the following advice:
"The following method if observed in walking
and standing, will impart a desirable physical
poise and will keep you erect and in a graceful
attitude while walking: Stand with your back
toward the wall, with the heels, legs, hips,
shoulders and back of head touching the wall,
and with the chin slightly drawn in. Press up
against the wall firmly. You will find yourself
in an uncomfortable position, and one that is
unnatural and incorrect. Then, keeping your
heels to the wall, allow your body to swing
forward into a natural position, being careful
to keep the body firm in the same 'form,'
avoiding relaxation, swinging yourself forward
from the ankle joints alone. When you
find that the correct poised, natural position
has been attained, hold it, and march forward
in what will be the natural, normal, well-balanced
walking position. Practice this re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>peatedly,
several times every day, until you
have fully acquired the habit."</p>

<p><i>Shaking Hands.</i> When you grasp another's
hand in the act of "shaking hands,"
do not do so in a listless, cold-blooded manner&mdash;do
not extend to the other man a flabby,
clammy, fish-like hand. But take hold of his
hand as if you liked to do it&mdash;throw interest
into the proceeding. More than this&mdash;throw
feeling into it. Throw into the hand-clasp the
feeling: "<i>I like you, and you like me</i>." Then,
when you draw your hand away, if possible let
your fingers slide over the palm of his hand in
a caressing manner, allowing his first finger to
pass between your thumb and forefinger, close
up in the crotch of the thumb. Practice this
well, until you can perform it without thinking
of it. You will find merit in the method.
Grasp the other person's hand "as if he were
your best girl's millionaire father-in-law."</p>

<p><i>Voice.</i> The Salesman should cultivate a
voice with expression in it. His voice should
convey his belief in what he is saying, and his
interest in the story. You will find it an aid
in this direction if you will learn to visualize
your thoughts&mdash;that is, to make a mental pic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>ture
of the thing you are saying. One can always
describe better that which they see before
them. In the degree that you can see your
mental picture, so will be your degree of power
in expressing it to another in words, and so
will be the degree of feeling in your tone. The
voice should express the meaning of your
thought rather than being merely the symbol
of it. Try to say "Good Morning" as if you
meant it&mdash;then say it in the usual way. Do
you see the difference? Throw your thought
and feeling into your voice. Forget all about
yourself and the other man and concentrate
your thought and feeling into your voice.</p>

<p>Many people make the mistake of "speaking
with their muscles instead of with their
nerves." They throw muscular energy into
their words, when they should use nervous
energy, or thought-force. The former has but
little effect on the mind of the other, while
the second vibrates subtly and reaches the
feelings of those addressed. <i>Feel</i>, when you
wish to speak impressively, and your tones
will reflect the same, and induce a similar feeling
in others. It is a point worth remembering
that one may "bring down" the voice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
an excited person to one's own pitch, if the
latter is firmly held at the customary pitch, in
a firm manner. Not only does this "bring
down" the other man's voice, but his feelings
will also follow suit, and besides, you also
manage to keep your own temper and poise.
Never raise your voice because another raises
his&mdash;resist the tendency, and maintain your
poise and power by so doing. This is worth
remembering.</p>

<p><i>The Eyes.</i> Learn to look people in the eyes
when you are speaking to them. Not in a
staring manner, but firmly, politely and easily.
This may be acquired with a little practice.
Practice on yourself in the mirror if you prefer.
A shifting, restless gaze produces a bad
impression, while a firm, honest gaze will incline
people in your favor. You will find that
strong men&mdash;men who influence others&mdash;almost
always have a firm, strong gaze. It is
worth practice, work and time, to acquire this
personal trait.</p>

<p><i>Clothes.</i> A man is very often known by his
clothes, or at least judged by them. The Salesman
should pay attention to this point of personal
expression, since it will count much for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
or against him. The first point to remember
is that <i>cleanliness</i> is the first requisite in clothing.
Keep your clothes clean and well
pressed. Particularly keep your linen clean,
for nothing in the way of dress acts so much
against a man as soiled linen. Another important
point is to keep the extremities well
clad&mdash;that is, the head, feet and hands. A
soiled or worn hat; a soiled or frayed collar;
an old, or unpolished pair of shoes; ragged
sleeves or frayed cuffs&mdash;these things are more
easily noticed and count more against a man
than a shabby suit. Better an old suit well
brushed, with a good hat, shoes and clean
cuffs&mdash;than the reverse.</p>

<p>One should always wear as good clothes as
his means will permit, and such as will be in
keeping with his occupation and position. The
rule is to get as good material as possible, and
cut reasonably within the prevailing style&mdash;but
avoiding all extremes, or fanciful designs.
<i>A well-dressed business man should give
neither the appearance of shabbiness nor of
being "dressed-up."</i> He should present the
appearance of general neatness without attracting
any special attention to his clothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
When a man's clothes specially attract one,
that man is not well dressed, but either poorly
dressed or over-dressed. The "happy mean"
between the two extremes is to be sought after.
Polonius' advice to his son is well worth memorizing:
"Costly thy habit as thy purse can
buy, but not expressed in fancy; rich, not
gaudy; for the apparel oft proclaims the
man."</p>

<p><i>Details of Appearance.</i> Personal cleanliness
and neatness are pre-requisites of the
Salesman who wishes to produce a favorable
impression. There is nothing that will so tend
to prejudice the average business man against
a new caller as the appearance of neglect of
personal care. The body should be well-bathed;
the hair trimmed and neatly brushed;
the face cleanly shaven; the teeth well
brushed; the nails clean; the shoes polished;
the necktie and collar clean; the clothes
brushed. Avoid the smell of liquor or tobacco
on the breath, and eschew as fatal the odor of
strong perfumery on the clothes or handkerchief.
The yellow stains of the cigarette
showing on the fingers, and the disgusting
odor attaching to the cigarette habit, have lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
many a man a favorable bearing. The cigarette
is "taboo" to many men who smoke
other forms of tobacco. These things are instinctively
recognized by the buyer as manifestations
of the mind of the salesman&mdash;a
part of his personality&mdash;and very rightly so,
for if the mind be kept above them they do not
manifest. All these things go toward forming
the impression which one person always makes
upon another at the first meeting, and which
have so much to do with securing a favorable
notice during the Approach of the Salesman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="chap">THE MIND OF THE BUYER</p>


<p>The second important element in a sale is
the Mind of the Buyer. In the mind of the
buyer is fought the battle of the sale. Within
its boundaries are manifested the movements
which win or lose the day. As a writer on the
subject has said: "The buyer's brain is the
board upon which the game is played. The
faculties of the brain are the men. The salesman
moves or guides these faculties as he
would chess men or checkers on a board." In
order to understand the ground upon which
your battle must be fought, and the mental
elements which you must combat, persuade,
move, push or attract, you must understand
the various faculties of the mind, as well as
the mind as a whole. Let us, therefore, consider
the various mental faculties which are
employed actively by a buyer in the mental
process of a purchase.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>I. <i>Quality.</i> In the first place, let us
consider that which the phrenologists call
"Quality," by which they express the various
degrees of fineness or coarseness in a man's
mental make-up which is usually indicated by
his appearance and physical characteristics.
This "quality" in a man is akin to what we
call "class," "breeding," or "blood" in the
higher animals. It is difficult to explain, but
is universally recognized. At one extreme of
"quality" we find those individuals who are
fine-grained, refined, high-strung, intense, and
inclined to be susceptible to emotional or sentimental
influence, poetry, music, etc., and are
apt to be more or less impractical and out of
harmony with the material world of men and
affairs. At the other extreme we find those
individuals who are coarse-grained, of coarse
and unrefined tastes, animal, gross, unrefined,
and generally "swinish." Between these two
extremes we find many degrees in the scale.
The outward physical signs of the person,
such as the coarseness or fineness of his skin,
hair, nails, ears and facial features, as well as
his general form and characteristics, will
usually give the careful observer the key to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
the degree of a man's "quality." It will be
well for the Salesman to acquaint himself with
these characteristics, for they throw much
light on the general character of people.</p>

<p>Next in order come what are called the Temperaments,
by which term phrenologists designate
the general classes into which individuals
fit. As a rule, however, an individual manifests
the elements of several of the temperaments&mdash;that
is, they blend in him. The best
phrenological authorities classify the temperaments
as follows: (1) The Vital; (2) The
Motive; (3) The Mental; the characteristics of
which are described as follows:</p>

<p><i>The Vital Temperament.</i> This temperament
is indicated by a predominance of the
purely physical or "animal" propensities.
Those in whom it predominates are distinguished
by a round head, wide space between
the corners of the eyes and the ears, side-head
full, broad forehead (not necessarily high).
They are generally fleshy with a "well-fed"
appearance, inclined to be broad shouldered
and deep chested and with a "bull neck"&mdash;splendid
animals, in fact. Their mental char<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>acteristics
are love of eating and drinking, and
animal comforts; impulsiveness, impetuosity,
heartiness, quick temper, zeal and
ardor, often shrewd and cunning but without
great depth, susceptible to flattery and appeal
to selfish emotions and prejudices, and loving
pleasure. They are generally selfish and
grasping toward that which caters to their
pleasure and physical welfare. Try to "get
all that is coming to them," and yet at the
same time tend toward conviviality and are
desirous of being thought "good fellows." Are
usually excitable, and are easily thrown off
their balance. Those in whom this temperament
is deficient manifest physical characteristics
opposite to those above mentioned, and
are more or less anaemic, or bloodless, and
show a lack of vitality and physical well-being.
Those in whom this temperament predominates
make good butchers, hotel-keepers, captains,
locomotive engineers, traders, politicians,
contractors, etc. They are reached
through their feelings rather than through
their intellect.</p>

<p><i>The Motive Temperament.</i> This temperament
is indicated by a predominance of mus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>cular
strength, endurance, toughness, and
powers of action. Those in whom it predominates
are distinguished by a general leanness
and spareness; strongly marked and prominent
features, usually with a large nose and
high cheek bones; large and strong teeth;
large joints and knuckles&mdash;the Abraham Lincoln
physical characteristics, in fact. Their
mental characteristics are determination, persistence,
combativeness, destructiveness, endurance,
thoroughness, management, executive
ability, creative power, stubbornness,
powers of resistance, and often an indomitable
spirit. Their emotions are not on the surface,
but when once aroused are strong and persistent.
They are slow to wrath, but are good
fighters and will stay to the finish. They are
generally canny and shrewd, instinctively.
They are the active and persistent workers of
the world. It is this temperament in one
which supplies his motive power&mdash;his ability
and taste for work. Those in whom this temperament
is deficient manifest physical characteristics
opposite to those above mentioned,
and accordingly are averse to work or exertion
of any kind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Mental Temperament.</i> This temperament
is indicated by a predominance of
nervous force, mental activity, reasoning
power, imagination, and a brain development
rather than bodily strength or physical activity.
Those in whom it predominates are
distinguished by a slight build, small bones
and muscles, general fineness of structure,
quick motions, signs of nervous energy, sharp
features, thin lips, thin, finely shaped, and
often pointed nose, high forehead, and expressive
eyes. Their mental characteristics
are activity in reasoning processes, active imagination,
susceptibility to disturbance from
uncongenial environment and distasteful company,
love of mental activity and often a distaste
for physical activity, sensitiveness, extremes
of feeling and emotion, eager and enthusiastic,
and the general traits popularly
designated as "temperamental." Those in
whom this temperament is deficient manifest
characteristics opposite to those above mentioned,
and are averse to mental activity.</p>

<p><i>Blended Temperaments.</i> Nearly every individual
possesses the three temperaments
blended in various proportions and combina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>tions.
In some, one temperament predominates
largely and gives us the distinctive characteristics
of that class. But in others, often
two temperaments will predominate, leaving
the third scarcely manifest. In others, the
three are so well blended and balanced that the
individual is known as "well balanced" temperamentally&mdash;this
being considered the ideal
condition.</p>

<p>Prof. Fowler, one of the old authorities in
phrenology, says of the blended temperaments:
"Excessive Motive with deficient Mental
gives power and sluggishness, so that the
talents lie dormant. Excessive Vital gives
physical power and enjoyment, but too little
of the mental and moral, along with coarseness
and animality. Excessive Mental confers
too much mind for body, too much sentimentalism
and exquisiteness, along with
greenhouse precocity. Whereas their equal
balance gives an abundant supply of vital
energy, physical stamina, and mental power
and susceptibility. They may be compared to
the several parts of a steamboat and its appurtenances.
The Vital is the steampower;
the Motive, the hulk or frame-work; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Mental, the freight and passengers. The Vital
predominating, generates more animal energy
than can well be worked off, and causes restlessness,
excessive passion, and a pressure
which endangers outbursts and overt actions;
predominant Motive gives too much frame or
hulk; moves slowly, and with weak Mental is
too light freighted to secure the great ends of
life; predominant Mental overloads, and endangers
sinking; but all equally balanced and
powerful, carry great loads rapidly and well,
and accomplish wonders. Such persons unite
cool judgment with intense and well governed
feelings; great force of character and intellect
with perfect consistency; scholarship with
sound common sense; far seeing sagacity with
brilliancy; and have the highest order of both
physiology and mentality."</p>

<p>The Salesman should thoroughly acquaint
himself with the characteristics of each of the
three temperaments, and should also learn to
analyze them when found blended and in combination.
An understanding of a man's temperament
will often give one the key to his
general character and disposition, which will
be of the greatest advantage to the Salesman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Many students of human nature devote their
entire attention to a study of the several faculties
of the mind, ignoring the force and effect
of the temperaments. We consider this to be
a mistake, for a thorough knowledge of the
temperaments gives one a general key to character,
and, as a fact, it is generally found that
given a certain temperament or combination
of the same, a good phrenologist will be able
to indicate just what faculties are apt to be
found in the ascendency in such a character.
And as the average Salesman cannot spare the
time to become an expert phrenologist, it will
be seen that a correct knowledge of the temperaments
gives him his best working knowledge
of the subject of character reading.</p>

<p>Let us now consider the various groups of
mental faculties which are manifested by the
buyer in his business, and which should be understood
by the Salesman in order that he may
successfully meet the impulses arising therefrom
in the mind of the buyer. Our consideration
of these groups of faculties must necessarily
be brief, but we shall include the essential
features.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Social Faculties.</i> This group of faculties
includes <i>Amativeness</i> or Sexuality; <i>Conjugality</i>
or Marital Inclination; <i>Parental Love</i>
or Love of Offspring; <i>Friendship</i> or Love of
Companionship; <i>Inhabitiveness</i> or Love of
Home. Phrenology teaches that this group of
organs occupies the lower back portion of the
head, giving the appearance of bulging behind
the ears. <i>Amativeness</i> or Sexuality when
highly developed causes one to be at the mercy
of the attraction of the opposite sex. While
normally developed it plays a worthy part in
life, its excessive development manifests in
licentiousness, and when deficient manifests
in an aversion to the opposite sex or a coldness
and reserve. Persons in whom this
faculty is in excess will neglect business for
sex attraction, and will allow themselves to be
"sidetracked" by reason thereof. In selling
a man of this kind, keep him away from this
particular subject, or he will not give you his
attention. <i>Conjugality</i> or Marital Inclination
when highly developed causes one to be largely
influenced by one's companion in marriage. A
man of this kind will be largely governed by
his wife's wishes, tastes and desires, conse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>quently
if his wife "says so" the battle is won.
Some men, however, while having Amativeness
largely developed, have but small Conjugality,
and if one love is not found satisfactory,
another is substituted&mdash;an "affinity"
takes the wife's place. <i>Parental Love</i> or Love
of Offspring when highly developed causes
one to idolize his children and to be capable of
influence through them. Such men are prone
to relate anecdotes regarding their children
and to bore listeners with recitals of infantile
brightness and precocity. They generally
have photographs of their children about their
desks. An appeal to the interests of the children
always reaches the attention and interest
of these people. <i>Friendship</i>, or Love of Companionship,
when highly developed causes one
to seek society, form attachments of friendship,
enjoy social pleasures, do favors for
those whom they like, enjoy entertaining and
being entertained. Such a man will be more
apt to base his business dealings upon likes
and acquaintance rather than upon reason or
judgment, and are comparatively easily persuaded
by those whom they like. An appearance
of sociability generally attracts them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
those manifesting it. The quality of "good
fellowship" appeals to this class. <i>Inhabitiveness</i>
or Love of Home when highly developed
causes one to become <i>attached to places</i>, localities
and associations. Such a man will be full
of patriotism, local pride and prejudice and
provincialism. He will resent any apparent
"slur" upon his locality, and will appreciate
any favorable comment on his home place and
locality. These people are like cats who are
attached to places rather than to people.
Their township is usually their idea of "my
country."</p>

<p><i>The Selfish Faculties.</i> This group of faculties
includes <i>Vitativeness</i>, or Love of Life;
<i>Combativeness</i>, or Love of Opposing; <i>Destructiveness</i>,
or Love of Breaking Through; <i>Alimentiveness</i>,
or Love of Appetite; <i>Bibativeness</i>,
or Love of Drink; <i>Acquisitiveness</i>, or
Love of Gain; <i>Secretiveness</i>, or Cunning;
<i>Cautiousness</i>, or Prudence; <i>Approbativeness</i>,
or Love of Praise; <i>Self Esteem</i>, or Self Reliance.
Phrenology teaches that this group of
organs occupy the sides of the back part of the
head. <i>Vitativeness</i>, or Love of Life, when
highly developed causes one to manifest a de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>termination
to live, and a great fear of death.
Anything promising increased health or long
life will greatly attract these people, and anything
arousing a fear of ill health or death
will influence them greatly. These people are
excellent customers for health appliances,
books on health, etc. <i>Combativeness</i>, or Love
of Opposing, when highly developed causes
one to desire a "scrap" or an argument or debate.
These people can best be handled by
seemingly allowing them to win in argument,
and then leading them to suggest the thing
that the Salesman has had in his mind all the
time. These people may be led, or coaxed, but
never driven. With them it is always a case
of "sugar catches more flies than vinegar,"
or of the hot sun causing the man to drop the
cloak which the fierce north wind was unable
to blow away from him. A man of this kind
will be so pleased at beating another in an
argument on a minor point, that he will forget
the main point and will be in a humor to be
persuaded. Always avoid a direct argument
or dispute with these people on important
points&mdash;they will let their pride of combat
obscure their judgment. But they will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
ready to bestow favors on those whom they
believe they have worsted in argument. <i>Destructiveness</i>,
or Love of Breaking Through,
when highly developed causes one to take
great pleasure in doing things in new ways;
in breaking precedents and defying authority,
and in breaking down obstacles. If you can
arouse this spirit in such a man, by showing
him how he may do these things with your
goods, he will fall in line. A man of this kind
may be interested at once in any proposition
whereby he may be enabled to do something in
a novel way here&mdash;to defy opposition or established
custom&mdash;or to break down opposing obstacles.
The keynote of this faculty is:
"Make Way." <i>Alimentiveness</i>, or Love of
Appetite, when highly developed causes one
to incline toward gluttony and gormandizing,
and to place undue importance upon the
pleasures of the table. A man of this kind
"lives to eat" instead of "eating to live," and
may be reached through his weakest point&mdash;his
stomach. To such a man a good dinner is
more convincing than a logical argument.
<i>Bibativeness</i>, or Love of Drink, when highly
developed causes one to manifest an inordi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>nate
taste for liquids of all kinds. In some
cases, where alcoholic drinks are avoided by
such people, they will run to excess in the direction
of "soft drinks" such as ginger ale,
soda water, etc. It does not follow that these
people are fond of the effects of alcohol, the
craving seemingly being for liquids in some
form. Such people, if their appetites are not
controlled, will let their taste for drinks run
away with their judgment and reason.</p>

<p><i>Acquisitiveness</i>, or Love of Gain, when
highly developed causes one to be very grasping,
avaricious, and often miserly. But, when
not so highly developed, it causes one to manifest
a keen trading instinct, and is a necessary
factor in the mental make-up of the successful
merchant. Those in whom it is highly developed
will be interested in any proposition
which seems to them to promise gain or saving.
In selling such a man, the effort should
be to keep the one point of <i>profit or saving</i> always
in evidence. In some cases this faculty,
too highly developed and not counterbalanced
by other faculties, will make a man "penny
wise and pound-foolish," and will focus his
mental gaze so closely on the nickel held close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
to his eye that he will not see the dollar a little
further off. The "money talk" is the only
one that will appeal to these people.</p>

<p><i>Secretiveness</i>, or Cunning, when highly developed
causes one to incline toward double-dealing,
duplicity, trickery and deception. It
is the "foxy" faculty, which, while useful to a
certain degree, becomes undesirable when carried
to excess. In dealing with a man of this
kind, be on guard so far as accepting his statements
at full value is concerned. Accept his
statements "with a grain of salt." Those who
wish to "fight the devil with his own fire" can
reach these people by allowing them to think
that they are overreaching or getting the best
of the Salesman. The Salesman who is apparently
defeated by these people, is very apt
to have discounted their methods in advance,
and has mapped out his line of retreat in advance
so that the defeat is really a victory.
These people often will sacrifice a real advantage
concerning a big thing for the sake of
tricking one out of a small advantage. To
trick another causes them to feel a glow of
righteous well-being and self-satisfaction, and
makes them forget the main point in the deal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
A small victory thus won acts on them like the
good dinner to the Alimentive man, or flattery
to the Approbative person. A faculty developed
to excess is always a weak point which
can be used by others who understand it.</p>

<p><i>Cautiousness</i>, or Prudence, while an admirable
quality when normally developed, becomes,
when highly developed, an undesirable
quality. When highly developed it causes one
to be over-anxious, fearful, afraid to act, liable
to panic, etc. These people must be cultivated
carefully, and led to acquire confidence
and trust. One should be very careful in dealing
with these people not to cause suspicion or
alarm. They should be treated with the utmost
fairness, and given full explanations of
matters of which they are in doubt. As a rule
they are very slow in giving confidence, but
when they once place confidence in a person
they are very apt to stick to him. Their very
fearfulness acts to prevent their making
changes when confidence is once secured.
These people cannot be "rushed," as a rule&mdash;they
require time in order to gain confidence.
They are, however, subject to an occasional
"rush" by reason of their panicky disposition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
if they can be made to fear that if they do not
act some competitor will be given the chance,
or that prices will advance if they do not order
at once. These people must be handled carefully,
and the Salesman who masters their nature
will be well repaid for his trouble and
pains.</p>

<p><i>Approbativeness</i>, or Love of Praise, when
highly developed causes one to be susceptible
to flattery, desirous of praise, fond of "showing
off" and displaying himself, vain, sensitive
to criticism, and generally egotistical and
often pompous. This quality when highly developed
is a weakness and gives to an adversary
a powerful lever to work. The Salesman,
while secretly detesting this quality in a buyer,
nevertheless finds it a very easy channel of approach
and weapon of success, when he once
understands its characteristics. These people
can be reached by an apparent "falling in"
with their opinion of themselves, and a manifestation
of the proper respect in manner and
words. These are the people to whom the
"soft soap" is applied liberally, and who are
carried away by an apparent appreciation of
their own excellence. They will be willing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
bestow all sorts of favors upon those who are
sufficiently able to "understand" them, and to
perceive the existence of those superlative
qualities which the cruel, cold, unfeeling world
has ignored. These are the people for whom
the word "jolly" was invented, and who are
ready to absorb the available world-supply of
that article.</p>

<p><i>Self Esteem</i>, or Self Reliance, is a very different
quality from that just described, although
many people seem unable to make the
distinction. Self Esteem when highly developed
causes one to appreciate one's powers
and qualities, while not blinding oneself to
one's faults. It gives a sense of self-help, self-respect,
self-reliance, dignity, complacency,
and independence. Carried to an extreme it
manifests as hauteur, superciliousness, imperiousness
and tyranny. It is a characteristic
of the majority of successful men who have
made their own way by their own efforts.
These people insist upon having their own
way, and using their own minds&mdash;they resent
apparent influence or suggestions, and often
deliberately turn down a proposition simply
because they think that an effort is being made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
to force them into it. The best way to deal
with these people is to frankly acknowledge
their right to think for themselves, both in
your manner, tone and actions&mdash;and to present
the proposition to them in an impersonal
way, apparently leaving the whole matter to
their own good judgment. A logical appeal
appeals to them providing you do not make the
mistake of pitting yourself against them as
an opponent in argument. You may play the
part of the lawyer to them, but remember always
they want to play the part of judge, and
not that of the opposing counsel. If a matter
be subtly suggested to them in such a way as
to make them think that they have thought
it themselves, they will favor it. Always give
them a chance to think out the point themselves&mdash;they
like it. One need not cringe to or
flatter these people. All that is necessary is
to maintain your own self-respect, but at the
same time let them walk a little ahead of you,
or stand just a little bit higher&mdash;that is all they
need to make them feel comfortable. They
much prefer being a little higher or ahead of a
strong man than a weakling&mdash;it is more com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>plimentary
to them. They appreciate the one
who forces them to use their heaviest guns&mdash;but
who finally allows them to claim the
victory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="chap">THE MIND OF THE BUYER (CONTINUED)</p>


<p><i>The Faculties of Application.</i> This group
consists of two qualities: that of <i>Firmness</i>, or
Decision; and that of <i>Continuity</i>, or Patience.
These faculties, together with Self-Esteem,
are located at the upper-back, or back-upper,
part of the head.</p>

<p><i>Firmness</i>, or Decision, when highly developed
causes one to manifest stability, tenacity,
fixedness of purpose, often reaching the point
of obstinacy, mulishness and stubbornness.
These people cannot be driven, or forced into
anything. They are "mighty set" in their
ways, and when they once take a position are
very apt to stick to it "right or wrong." They
are apt to fight to the last ditch for what they
consider principle, and will hold on to the end
in what they believe to be right. To attempt
to drive them by force is to dash one's head
against a stone wall. The only way to handle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
these people is to endeavor to get them interested
in your side of the case before they have
"set" their minds and made up their opinion.
If they have already been prejudiced against
your case, the only way is to give up the fight
from the front, and endeavor to present the
matter from a different viewpoint, or angle, so
that new points will be presented which take
the matter out of the old category. These people
will never give in unless they can say:
"Oh, that of course alters the matter entirely;"
or "Oh, well, that places it in a new
light;" or "That is an entirely different proposition,"
etc. Leave them victors of the positions
upon which they are "set," and endeavor
to enlist their interest upon some new
aspects, points, or principles&mdash;you have at
least an even chance of winning on the new
point, whereas you have none whatever on the
old one. If, however, you can fit your case to
some of their established prejudices, for or
against, you have won your battle, for their
quality of stability will then be employed in
your favor instead of against it. You will have
to fit your case to their moulds&mdash;cut your garment
according to their pattern. A stubborn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
and balky horse or mule can often be started
in motion by turning its attention to a new
thing&mdash;such as putting a piece of twisted
paper in its ear, adjusting its harness in a
new way, etc. The same principle will work
on stubborn men, "set" in their ways. Get
their mind off the point in question, and they
will be rational. Let them have their own way
about their own points&mdash;and then plan a flank
or rear attack on them. You cannot batter
down their stone-wall&mdash;you must either soar
over it, tunnel under it, or else go around it.</p>

<p><i>Continuity</i>, or Patience, when highly developed
causes one to "stick to" a thing once
undertaken; to manifest patience and perseverance,
and to give up the mind to one thing
to the exclusion of others. It is difficult to interest
these people in new things&mdash;they instinctively
distrust the <i>new</i> idea or thing, and
cling to the old. These people are very conservative
and dislike change. They can be
dealt with best by avoiding shocking them
with entirely <i>new</i> things, and by carefully attaching
the newer idea or thing to the old so
that it seems a part of the latter. New things
under old names do not disturb these people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
as much as old things under new names&mdash;it is
the form and name, rather than the substance
with them. Old wine in new bottles they abhor&mdash;but
new wine in old bottles they will stand.
Arguments based on "old established" things,
or "good old-time" things, appeal to them.
Things must be "respectable," "well-established,"
"standing the test of years," "no
new-fangled notion," etc., to appeal to them.
Beware of trying new and startling changes
on them&mdash;they will be prejudiced against you
at once. Fall in with their ideals, and they will
be excellent friends and steady customers.
The words "conservative" and "established"
sound well to their ears. On the contrary, people
in whom this faculty is deficient will incline
toward new things because they are new.
This faculty, either in excess or when deficient,
strongly affects the judgment, and must be
taken into consideration by the Salesman.</p>

<p><i>The Religio-Moral Faculties.</i> This group
of faculties includes <i>Conscientiousness</i>, or
Moral Principle; <i>Hope</i>, or Optimism; <i>Spirituality</i>,
or other-worldliness; <i>Veneration</i>, or
Reverence; and <i>Benevolence</i>, or Human Kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>ness.
The organs manifesting these qualities
are located in the front-top of the head.</p>

<p><i>Conscientiousness</i>, or Moral Principle, when
highly developed gives one a high sense of
right, justice, truth, virtue, and duty. In dealing
with these people be particularly careful
to make no misstatements, misrepresentations,
and exaggerations, but to adhere
closely to the facts of the case. Avoid also any
appearance of trickiness or sharp practice,
stories of shrewd bargains, etc. These people
become staunch, firm friends if dealt with
as they deserve, but become prejudiced
against people and houses whom they suspect
of unfair dealings, or in whom they lose
confidence. Their keynote is "right's right"&mdash;and
you should adhere to it in all dealings
with them. They are "the salt of the earth,"
and it is a pity that there are not more of them.
It is true that sometimes this faculty seems to
become perverted into phariseeism and hypocrisy&mdash;but,
then, every good thing has its counterfeit,
and the thing to do is to distinguish
between the true and the false, here as elsewhere.</p>

<p><i>Hope</i>, or Optimism, when highly developed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
causes one to look on the bright side of things,
expect favorable outcomes, look confidently
forward, and expect much from the future.
Its perversion manifests in visionary dreams
and castle-building. These people are amenable
to appeals to future success, bright prospects,
cheerful outlook, and new undertakings
which seem promising. They become enthusiastic
when propositions are properly presented
to them, and prefer to deal with Salesmen
of similar mental characteristics. These
people are natural "bulls" in business&mdash;beware
of posing as a "bear" when dealing with
them. They relish a good cheering, cheerful
talk more than anything else. They are good
people to deal with, particularly if the quality
in question is balanced by caution and trained
by experience.</p>

<p><i>Spirituality</i>, or Other-worldliness, when
highly developed tends to cause one to live on
mental heights above the things of ordinary
material existence; to trust to the "inner
light;" to incline toward mysticism; and to
experience a religious consciousness above the
ordinary. When manifested in a lesser degree
it is evidenced by the ordinary "relig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>ious"
feeling. Perverted, it manifests as superstition,
credulity and "psychism." The
people in whom this faculty is active seem to
feel that business is a degrading necessity, and
they are never thoroughly at home in it, unless
the goods handled happen to be along the lines
of their general inclination, as for instance,
religious books, etc. Consequently, their business
traits and tastes arise from the other
faculties, rather than from this particular one.
However, they are easily prejudiced against
one whom they imagine does not agree with
them in their beliefs and convictions, and are
apt to be swayed rather more by feeling, emotion
and sentiment than by cool judgment and
pure reason. They are usually strong in their
likes and dislikes, and are susceptible to appeals
to their imagination.</p>

<p><i>Veneration</i>, or Reverence, when highly
developed causes one to manifest reverence
and extreme respect to authority of all
kinds. These people are usually good church
members and law abiding citizens. In business,
the faculty is apt to cause them to
place great stress upon authority and example.
If some large merchant has ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
certain goods, they will be impressed
by his example. They regard testimonials
and recommendations highly. In dealing
with them one must avoid speaking lightly
of any thing or person esteemed by them,
for they will be quick to resent it. They
are usually decidedly conventional, and aim to
meet the full requirements of "respectability"
and social customs.</p>

<p><i>Benevolence</i>, or Human Kindness, when
highly developed causes one to manifest sympathy,
kindness, generosity, and philanthropy.
These people are altruistic and always ready
to do another a good turn. They are moved
by their feelings rather than by their reason
and judgment, and will often base their business
transactions rather more upon friendliness
and personal feeling than upon cold business
judgment and policy. They are generous
where their sympathies and feelings are interested,
and are too often taken advantage of
by selfish people who play on their unselfish
natures. Too often are they considered
"easy," and are imposed on accordingly. The
personal equation of the Salesman plays an
important part in dealing with these people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>From these several groups of faculties arise
many combinations of character in people.
While it is true that there is almost infinite
variety among people, nevertheless, it is true
that there are a few general classes into which
the majority of buyers may be fitted or
grouped for convenience. Let us now consider
some of the more common classes, and see how
the faculties, in combination, manifest themselves.</p>

<p><i>The Argumentive Buyer.</i> This man finds
his greatest pleasure in arguing, combating
and disputing with the Salesman&mdash;argument
for the sake of argument, not for the sake of
truth or advantage. This trait arises from developed
Combativeness and Destructiveness.
Do not take these people too seriously. Let
them enjoy a victory over you on minor points,
and then after yielding gracefully coax them
along the main lines of the selling talk. At
the best, they are arguing over terms, definitions,
forms, etc. and not over <i>facts</i>. Let them
make their own definitions, terms and forms&mdash;and
then take their order for the goods which
you have fitted into their side of the argument.
If, however, the argument is based upon true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
reasoning and with a legitimate intent, then
reason with him calmly and respectfully.</p>

<p><i>The Conceited Buyer.</i> This fellow is full of
Approbativeness. We have told you about
him elsewhere. Meet him on his own plane,
and give him the particular bait indicated for
his species&mdash;he will rise to it. Appearing to
defer to him, you may work in your arguments
and selling talk without opposition. Prefacing
your explanation with "As you know by
your own experience;" or "as your own good
judgment has decided;" etc., you may tell
your story without much opposition. You
must always let him feel that you realize that
you are in the presence of a great man.</p>

<p><i>The "Stone Wall" Buyer.</i> This man has
Self Esteem and Firmness largely developed.
We have told you about him under those two
headings. You must fly over, tunnel under,
or walk around his stone wall of reserve
and stubbornness. Let him keep his wall
intact&mdash;he likes it, and it would be a shame
to deprive him of it. A little careful search
will generally show that he has left his flanks,
or his rear unguarded. He will not let you in
the front door&mdash;so go around to the kitchen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
door, or the side-door of the sitting room&mdash;they
are not so well guarded.</p>

<p><i>The Irritable Buyer.</i> This is an unpleasant
combination of Approbativeness and Combativeness,
in connection with poor digestion
and disordered nerves. Do not quarrel with
him, and let his manner slide over you like
water off a duck's back. Stick to your selling
talk, and above everything keep cool, confident,
and speak in even tones. This course
will tend to bring him down. If you show that
you are not afraid of him, and cannot be made
angry&mdash;if your tones are firm yet under control
and not loud&mdash;he will gradually come
down to meet you. If you lose your own temper,
you may as well walk out. Simply ignore
his "grouch"&mdash;deny it out of existence,
as our New Thought friends would say.</p>

<p><i>The "Rough Shod" Buyer.</i> This man has
large Destructiveness, and Self Esteem, and
wants to run things himself. He will try to
ride rough shod over you. Keep cool, even-tempered,
self-possessed, and firm yet respectful.
Do not let him "rattle" you. It is
often more of a "bluff" than anything else.
Keep on "sawing wood;" and do not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
scared off. These people are often but "lath-and-plaster"
instead of the iron and steel
they appear to be at first sight. Keep firm and
calm, is the keynote in dealing with them.</p>

<p><i>The Cautious Buyer.</i> This man generally
has Cautiousness and Continuity well developed,
and Hope deficient. He is conservative
and fearful. Avoid frightening him with
ideas of "new" things or "experiments."
If you are selling new things or ideas, manage
to blend them in with things with which he is
familiar&mdash;associate the new and unfamiliar
with the old and familiar. And be conservative
and careful in your talk, do not give him
the idea that you are a radical or a "new
fangled idea" man. To him, be an "old fashioned
person."</p>

<p><i>The Cunning Buyer.</i> This fellow has large
Secretiveness or Cunning&mdash;he belongs to the
fox tribe. He likes to scheme out things
for himself, so if you will content yourself
with giving him broad hints, accompanied by
expressive glances, regarding what can be
done with your goods, he will be apt to scheme
out something in that direction, and thinking
he has done it all himself, he will be pleased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
and interested. Let him know that you appreciate
his shrewdness, particularly if he shows
that his Approbativeness is well developed.
But, if not, better let him think that he is deceiving
you regarding his true nature. The
majority of cunning people, however, take
pride in it, and relish a little grim appreciation
of their quality.</p>

<p><i>The Dignified Buyer.</i> This man has large
Self Esteem, and probably also large Approbativeness.
In either case, let him play the
part for which Nature has cast him, and you
play yours. Your part is in recognizing and
respecting his dignity, by your manner and
tone. Whether the dignity be real or assumed,
a recognition of and falling in with it is appreciated
and relished. Imagine that you are
in the presence of your revered great-grandfather,
or the bishop, and the rest will be easy.
We once knew of a jovial, but indiscreet, salesman
who lost a large sale to a buyer of this
kind, by poking him in the ribs and calling
him "old chap." The buyer barely escaped
an attack of apoplexy&mdash;the Salesman entirely
escaped a sale.</p>

<p><i>The "Mean" Buyer.</i> This man is moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
by Acquisitiveness. He is suspicious of you
from the start, for he feels that you intend to
get some money from him. Don't blame him&mdash;he's
built that way. Instead, get his mind
off the subject and on to another, by plunging
in at once with the statement that you have
something upon which <i>he can make money</i>,
or something that <i>will save him money</i>. Emphasize
these points, and you will have
aroused his curiosity. Then proceed along
the same lines&mdash;something to make money for
him, or something to save money for him&mdash;these
are the only two arguments he can assimilate.</p>

<p><i>The Intelligent Buyer.</i> These people depend
almost entirely upon reason and judgment.
They are scarce. When you meet one
of them, drop all attempts to play upon weak
points, prejudices or feelings, and confine
yourself strictly to logical and rational statements,
presentation of your proposition, and
argument thereon. Do not attempt sophistry,
argument from false premises, or other fallacies.
He will detect them at once, and will
feel indignant. Talk straight from the shoul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>der,
and confine yourself to facts, figures,
principles, and logic.</p>

<p>So far we have dealt with the voluntary or
outer mind of the buyer. Let us now consider
his involuntary or inner mind. There are
many other terms used by psychologists to
designate these two phases of mind&mdash;the important
fact is that there are <i>two</i> phases or
planes of mind which are operative in a sale.
Let us see how they work, rather than what
they are, or what they are called.</p>

<p>Discarding, for the time being, the current
psychological theories and terminology, let us
take a plain look at the facts of the case. A
little consideration will show us that there are
two parts to a man's mind&mdash;or two phases of
activity. In the first place, there is a part of
one's mind which acts as does the mind of the
higher animal, the savage, the child. That is,
it acts upon impulse and without restraint of
the will. Its attention is easily attracted, but
held with difficulty unless the interest and
curiosity is awakened. It is curious, fond of
novelty, inquisitive, impulsive, easily persuaded
in certain directions, susceptible to
impressions, amenable to suggestion, imita<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>tive,
subject to panic, apt to "follow my
leader," emotional, depending upon feeling
rather than upon reason, subject to persuasion
and coaxing, and acting almost automatically
in response to awakened desire. Let
us think of this part of the mind as the inheritance
of the race from the past&mdash;the instinctive
mind&mdash;the elemental mind of the race
before Intellect mounted its throne. This part
of the mind is possessed by every individual
of the race. No matter how highly developed
the individual may be, he has this part of the
mind. No matter how much he may be in
control of it, it is always there as a background
and basis of his other kind of mind. The
difference in the self-control of individuals
depends almost altogether upon the other part
of the mind, which we shall now consider&mdash;the
Voluntary Mind, in which the Intellect and
Will are the predominant elements. The
phase which we have just considered may be
called the Involuntary Mind, in which Desire
and Feeling are the predominant elements.</p>

<p>The Voluntary Mind has come to man in
the course of evolution. It is not nearly so
highly developed in the majority of people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
as one might at first suppose. The majority
of the race have the Involuntary Mind predominant,
and are swayed more by feeling
and desire than by intellect and will. Those in
whom the Voluntary Mind is highly developed
place the intellect over the feelings&mdash;the will
over the desires. They submit their feelings
to the inspection and approval of their intellect,
and hold their desires in check by their
will. We are in the habit of thinking of will
as a something which acts&mdash;but in the majority
of instances it is found to be employed in
checking action of the desires&mdash;in holding
back rather than in pushing forward. One of
the chief duties of the developed will is that of
inhibition, or restraint. And inhibition depends
upon the decision of the judgment or
intellect. The animal, savage, or child has but
little power of this kind&mdash;the average individual
has more than the child or savage but less
than the developed individual&mdash;the developed
individual has better self-control, and subordinates
his emotional desires and feelings to
his judgment and will, by inhibition or restraint.
Every individual has both of these
phases of mind&mdash;the Involuntary and Volun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>tary&mdash;the
latter, however, being manifested
in an infinite variety of degrees of development
and power. Back of every Involuntary
Mind is to be found the protecting Voluntary
Mind&mdash;and likewise, back of every
Voluntary Mind, no matter how strong it may
be, there is ever the Involuntary Mind chafing
under restraint and striving to escape its
master's eye and express itself in its own
way. And the master often relaxes its attention,
or gets tired of its strenuous task, and
then the hidden nature "plays while the cat's
away."</p>

<p>Perhaps the Salesman may be able to remember
this classification of the two phases
of the mind, by picturing them as <i>two partners</i>
engaged in business. The Salesman is
trying to secure the trade of the firm. The
one brother is an easy-going fellow, possessing
curiosity and childish interest, capable
of being "jollied," persuaded and coaxed,
and apparently acting always from his momentary
desires and feelings, desirous of appearing
well in the eyes of others, and anxious
to make a good impression, finding it easier
to say "Yes," than "No"&mdash;easier to fall in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
with the wishes of others than to oppose them,
being vain and complaisant. This partner's
name is "Easyboy." The other partner is
an entirely different sort of fellow. He is cold
and calculating, manifesting very little feeling
or emotion, submitting everything to his
reason and judgment, not moved by prejudices
for or against, driving a close bargain and resenting
attempts to coax or drive him. His
name is "Hardfellow."</p>

<p>In the firm of "Easyboy and Hardfellow,"
the work is divided. "Easyboy" has much to
do about the place, attending to many things
for which his temperament specially fits him.
"Hardfellow," however, does the buying, for
experience has taught him that "Easyboy"
is not fitted for the task, being too much under
the sway of his feelings and being too easily
influenced. "Easyboy" never could say
"No," anyway&mdash;but "Hardfellow" finds it
almost as hard to say "yes." So "Hardfellow"
does the buying, but "Easyboy" always
"hangs 'round" when a salesman is
talking, for he is naturally inquisitive, and,
being jealous, rather resents "Hardfellow's"
authority in the matter. Sometimes he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
breaks in, and "Hardfellow" lets him have
his say, and at times indulges him in minor
purchases, for being a partner he must accord
him some consideration in spite of the arrangement
regarding duties. A strange thing
is that "Easyboy" is possessed of the notion
that he would make an ideal buyer, far better
than "Hardfellow" in fact, and he loses
no opportunity of manifesting his supposed
quality, notwithstanding the fact that he
usually makes a bungle of it.</p>

<p>For "Hardfellow" is often so busy that he
cannot give his full attention to the business
of buying; then again he becomes tired and
at such times his judgment is not so good, and
he is apt to be influenced by "Easyboy" at
such times; and, again, he becomes interested
in one feature of the purchase and overlooks
the others&mdash;at such times "Easyboy" "gets
in his fine work," and takes a hand in the
buying. The Salesmen who visit the firm are
fully aware of this condition of affairs, and
plan things so as to have "Easyboy" on hand
and able to play his part. They can do anything
with him, and the more he is in evidence
the better are their chances. If he had his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
way he would buy corner lots in the moon, or
gold-bricks minus the plating. He likes to
say "Yes" when coaxed, jollied or led. But
the Salesmen having a straight business proposition
of merit get along well with "Hardfellow,"
for he is reachable on such lines when
logically presented and explained in a business
way. Even such Salesmen, however, find
"Easyboy" a valuable ally, for he often gets
them a hearing when "Hardfellow" is busy
or otherwise not disposed to listen. And so,
they all find it an important question to get
"Easyboy" on the scene at "Hardfellow's"
elbow. Some claim to have discovered a
method whereby they can "sidetrack"
"Hardfellow" and get "Easyboy" to do the
buying. And rumor even has it that there
have been unscrupulous individuals who have
happened around when "Hardfellow" was
taking his <i>siesta</i> after a full dinner, and who
then played upon "Easyboy's" weakness in
a shameful manner. The firm deny these
rumors, but there is an old gold brick holding
back a door at the back part of the store; and
a big bundle of worthless shares in a nicely
printed gold-mine and a deed for a quarter-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>section
of the blue sky, in the safe&mdash;so there
may have been something in the tale, after
all.</p>

<p>Every mind is an "Easyboy and Hardfellow"
firm. Both partners are in evidence. In
some cases "Easyboy" has far more sway
and influence than his more capable partner;
in others they have equal authority; in a
third, "Hardfellow" asserts his right and
ability, and "Easyboy" has to take a back
seat under protest. But the same principle
is true of them all. And this fact is taken
into consideration by men of the world who
understand the true state of affairs. If anyone
doubts this statement of psychological facts,
let him analyze himself, and look back over
his own experience. He will find that "Easyboy"
has played him many a sad trick in the
past, and the "Hardfellow" has been "off
his job" more than once. Then let him begin
to analyze others with whom he comes in contact&mdash;he
will see the same state of affairs
existing there. And yet there is no mystery
about the matter&mdash;it is all in accordance with
known psychological laws. Some writers on
the subject of Salesmanship rather solemnly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
assure us that the "Easyboy" part of the
mind is a "higher mind"&mdash;but it is not. It
belongs to the <i>instinctive</i> stage of mental development,
rather than to the <i>rational</i>. It is
an inheritance from the past&mdash;that past in
which men were moved entirely by feeling and
emotion, before reason came to its present
stage of development. If it is "higher" why
is it a fact that the lower races and individuals
manifest it to a greater extent than the
higher ones? This part of the mind gives
vitality and energy to one, but unless it be
controlled by Intellect and Will it is apt to
prove a curse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="chap">THE PRE-APPROACH</p>


<p>Nearly all teachers of or writers upon
Salesmanship lay much stress upon what is
called "The Pre-Approach," by which term
is indicated the preliminaries leading up to
the Approach or Interview with the Buyer.</p>

<p>What we have said under the head of "The
Mind of the Salesman" is really a part of the
Pre-Approach, for it is in the nature of the
preparation of the mind of the salesman for
the interview with the buyer. But there is
more than this to the Pre-Approach. The
Pre-Approach is the mapping out of the campaign&mdash;"organizing
victory" it has been
called. It is the accumulation of ammunition
for the fight, and the laying out of the strategy.
Macbain says: "The Pre-Approach is
the groundwork upon which the salesman
builds. It comprises all the information obtainable
by him that will be of importance in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
making his approach in selling the customer.
* * * A sale, in fact, resembles chimney-building,
in which it takes more time for preliminary
scaffold-making than it does to
build the permanent structure once the scaffold
is made."</p>

<p>In the first place, an important part of the
Pre-Approach is a correct and complete
knowledge of your goods. Too many men
rush to the Approach without knowing what
they have to sell. It is not enough to know
brands and prices&mdash;one should <i>know</i> his goods
from top to bottom, inside and outside, from
the raw material to the finished article. He
should feel perfectly at home with his goods,
so that he may have full information regarding
them on tap, and thus have his mind free
for the strategy of the sale. A little close,
earnest intelligent study of one's line of
goods will not only supply one with an efficient
weapon, but will also impart to him a sense of
certainty and confidence that he cannot have
otherwise. What would be thought of a
teacher of natural history who did not understand
animals? And yet many salesmen are
equally as ignorant about their subject.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>The salesman should understand his goods
so thoroughly that he could write a treatise
on them, or demonstrate them before an audience
of experts or of persons entirely in ignorance
of them&mdash;the latter being probably the
hardest task. He should be able to explain
their particular virtues and characteristics
to a man old in the same line, or to explain
them simply and plainly to one who had never
seen them or who was ignorant of their uses.
We know of one salesman who was asked by
his little boy to explain a cash register to him,
and who complied with the request. He told
us that he learned more about his cash register
in the process of that explanation than he
had acquired in even the process of the technical
demonstration in the "salesman's
school" at the factory. It is not always policy
for the salesman to air his knowledge of his
goods to his customer&mdash;such a course would
generally bore the latter&mdash;but he should know
all about his goods, nevertheless. The man
who knows his goods in this way plants his
feet on the solid rock and cannot be swept
away, while the man who builds on the shift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>ing
sand of "half-knowledge" is always in
danger.</p>

<p>But the more popular branch of the Pre-Approach
is the knowledge of the customer. Get
as many points regarding the characteristics,
habits, likes and dislikes of the customer as
possible. Find out as much as you can about
his trade, and manner of conducting his business,
as well as his business history. Macbain
says: "There is really no information about
a prospective customer that can be said to be
valueless. On the other hand, a knowledge of
one or two of the characteristics of the man to
be approached may be considered sufficient,
the ready intuition of the salesman being relied
upon for the rest. It is assumed, of
course, that a salesman will be able to call his
man by name, pronouncing the name correctly
upon the very first interview. This is the
prime requisite, and the remaining knowledge
should be grouped about this in the order of
its importance."</p>

<p>The data regarding your prospective customer
is obtainable in many ways. Much of
it you may obtain from your house if they have
had previous dealings with him. Other sales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>men
will also add to the data, but one must be
on the lookout here and not allow himself to
be prejudiced against the customer, or frightened
by adverse reports regarding his manner
and characteristics coming from other
salesmen. Pierce says: "It would seem that
the good characteristics of the prospect are
desirable to learn. But it is a conviction that
by denying to one's self the unfavorable
things said about your prospect, you will not
accentuate the very qualities you hope to obviate.
One attempt at a sale is recalled where
the prospect was said to be 'the meanest
man on earth.' Almost terrified by the description,
the salesman went at the prospect
the wrong way; displeased him; lost the
sale."</p>

<p>Hotel clerks&mdash;or better still, hotel proprietors&mdash;are
often very well informed regarding
merchants in their town, and often valuable
information may be obtained in this way, although
the judgment and experience of the
hotel people must be appraised before basing
one's own opinion regarding the customer.
Other customers may also be diplomatically
pressed into service in obtaining information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
regarding their competitors, although allowance
must always be made for the personal
bias in such cases. It is a good idea for the
salesman to make a record of these advance
reports, so as to have them on file where he
may refer to them when needed. Some salesmen
have a card index devoted to this purpose,
which they have found very useful.</p>

<p>Another, and a very important point about
the Pre-Approach is that of developing the
proper Mental Attitude in yourself. You
must get <i>yourself</i> right first, before you can
get anything else right. Pierce says regarding
this: "Someone has said that the greatest
bane to selling goods is fear. As a matter of
fact, the only thing you are afraid of is that
you won't make the sale,&mdash;get the check. But,
if you waive this point, and say, 'Now, I don't
care whether I get this sale or not. I do know
this: I am honest, my goods are honest, and
if this man does not want them there are
plenty of men who do,' you will find the fear
melting like the mist before sunshine. Fear
cannot live in the presence of your smile, your
confidence, your knowledge of the business
and your industry."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>In this connection, re-read what we have
said to you regarding the "I" and "Self-Respect"
in the chapter entitled "The Mind of
the Salesman." This chapter was written to
cover just such cases as the one in question.
If you can realize the "I" within you, your
fear will disappear quickly. Remember,
"there's nothing to fear but Fear."</p>

<p>Many successful salesmen state that they
overcame their early fear and timidity by
filling themselves with auto-suggestions that
they were calling on the customer for the purpose
of doing him a good turn&mdash;that it was a
good thing for the customer that the salesman
was calling on him, although he did not know
it&mdash;and that he, the salesman must let nothing
stand in the way of doing that good turn
to the customer, etc. As ridiculous as this
may appear to some, it will be found to work
well in many cases. And it is based upon
truth, too, for if the goods are right, and the
prices are likewise, the salesman is doing the
customer a good turn.</p>

<p>And right here, let us impress upon you the
necessity of working yourself up to the point
of <i>believing thoroughly in your own proposi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>tion</i>.
You must get yourself into the state of
mind in which, if you were in the customer's
place, you would surely want to take advantage
of it. You must convert yourself before
you can expect to convert the customer. We
know an ad. man who tells us that he never
feels satisfied with an ad. that he is writing
until he can make himself believe that he
wants to buy the article himself. And he is
right. And the salesman will do well to take
a leaf from his book. Enthusiasm and belief
are contagious. If you believe thoroughly in
a thing, you run a much better chance of
making others believe in it also, than if you
feel otherwise. You must learn to <i>sell to
yourself</i> first, then you may sell to the customer.</p>

<p>W.C. Holman, in "Salesmanship," says:
"One cannot make others believe what he
himself believes, unless he himself is an
earnest believer. Dwight L. Moody swayed
enormous audiences by the simple power of
his own wonderful earnestness. No one could
listen to Moody without saying: 'This man
believes absolutely every word he is speaking.
If he feels what he says so tremendously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
there must be something in it.' If every salesman
realized how largely the attitude of the
'prospect' depended upon the salesman's own
mental attitude, he would be as careful to get
into the right frame of mind when he started
out to approach a prospect as he would be to
carry a sample case. It is a simple matter
for him to do this. All that is necessary is for
him to 'take account of stock' just before he
starts out&mdash;to enumerate to himself all the
strong, convincing points in his proposition&mdash;to
consider the good high qualities of the
goods he is selling&mdash;run over in his mind the
splendid characteristics of his house&mdash;think
of the great number of customers who have
bought his product&mdash;and of the supremely
satisfying reasons why other customers
should buy his goods. In other words, before
a salesman starts to sell other men, he should
sell himself. He should make this sale to
himself at the beginning of every day's
work."</p>

<p>The student should acquaint himself thoroughly
with the creative force of Suggestion
and Auto-Suggestion in Character Building,
and in producing and maintaining the proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
Mental Attitude. The volume of this series
entitled "<i>Suggestion and Auto-Suggestion</i>"
gives both the theory, principles and methods
of applying Auto-Suggestion in the directions
named. One need no longer be a slave
of his Mental Attitude. On the contrary he
may create and preserve the Mental Attitude
he deems advisable and necessary at any
time.</p>

<p>Mr. W.C. Holman, one of the best of the
inspirational writers on Salesmanship, gives
the following interesting instance of the use
of Auto-Suggestion by a salesman. He says:
"One of the best salesmen the writer ever
knew got up what he called his catechism. He
used to put himself through it every morning
before starting out. Oftentimes he repeated
it aloud if he had the opportunity. The questions
he would repeat in a quiet tone, but the
answers he would pronounce with all the
earnestness of which he was capable. His
catechism ran somewhat as follows:</p>

<p>"Am I working for a good house? YES!</p>

<p>"Has my house the reputation and prestige
of being one of the best in its line? YES!</p>

<p>"Have we made hundreds of thousands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
sales like the sales I am going to make to-day?
YES!</p>

<p>"Have we an enormous body of satisfied
users? YES!</p>

<p>"Am I selling the best goods of the kind
made anywhere in the world? YES!</p>

<p>"Is the price I am asking a fair one? YES!</p>

<p>"Do the men I am going to call on need the
article I am selling? YES!</p>

<p>"Do they realize that now? NO!</p>

<p>"Is that the very reason I am going to call
on them&mdash;because at present they don't want
my goods, and haven't yet bought them?
YES!</p>

<p>"Am I justified in asking a prospect's time
and attention to present my proposition?
BY ALL THE POWERS, YES!</p>

<p>"Am I going to get into the office of every
man that I call on, if there is any earthly way
to do it? YES!</p>

<p>"Am I going to sell every man I call on to-day?
YOU BET I AM!"</p>

<p>Referring to the above "catechism" of Mr.
Holman, we would say that if a man would
work himself up to the point of asking and
answering these questions in earnest, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
would carry the spirit thereof through the
day, he would render himself almost invincible.
A spirit like that is the spirit of the
Light Brigade, of Napoleon, of the Berserker
Norseman who made a way for himself. Such
a man would make opportunities, instead of
begging for them. Such a man would be inspired.
This is Auto-Suggestion raised to
the Nth Power. Try it&mdash;you need it in your
business!</p>

<p>The second phase of the Pre-Approach is
that of obtaining an interview with the prospective
customer, generally known as "the
prospect." In many instances the salesman is
able to secure the interview by simply walking
into the presence of the prospect, the
latter being in full view in his store or office
and no intermediary being present to intercept
the approach. In such cases the second
phase of the Pre-Approach is passed over,
and the actual Approach is entered into at
once. But in other cases, particularly in the
large office buildings of the principal cities,
the prospect is found to be in his private office,
and the salesman's advance is halted by a
clerk, or even an office boy, and there are cer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>tain
preliminaries to be gone through with
before an interview may be obtained. In many
cases, "big" men (or those who wish to be
considered "big") surround themselves with
so much formality and red-tape that it is quite
a feat to run the gauntlet of the guardians of
the inner temple, and much tact, diplomacy,
presence of mind, and often strategy is required
of the Salesman in order that he may
"get at his man."</p>

<p>Macbain, in his work entitled "Selling,"
says of this stage: "Between the pre-approach
and the actual approach sometimes lies
a trying time for the salesman. It is no uncommon
thing for a prospective customer to
keep a salesman waiting, either outside the
office door and out of sight, or inside and in
the presence of the prospective buyer. This
is known as 'breaking the salesman's nerve.'
It is often done with the idea of deliberately
making the salesman nervous and consequently
unable to make such an approach as
otherwise would be possible. Perhaps one of
the most common forms of this is seen when
the prospective customer appears to be very
busily interested in something at his desk and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
allows the salesman to stand an indefinite
length of time and then turns suddenly upon
him. This is especially disconcerting to the
young man, but the experienced salesman recognizes
it as an indication that either the man
is very busy and actually hates to take his
mind off his work, or that he is afraid of being
talked into something that he will later regret.
The salesman consequently shapes his
introduction accordingly and will in no wise
be disconcerted by this attempt as it will enable
him to study carefully the outward characteristics
of the man whom he is about to
approach."</p>

<p>In many cases this waiting is forced on the
salesman by a prospect who also knows something
of the laws of psychology&mdash;for such
knowledge is not confined to the salesman by
any means, the buyer having posted himself
in many cases. In the game of checkers or
draughts quite an important advantage accrues
to the player securing what is technically
known as "the move," which, however, is a
very different thing from the "first play."
There is in the psychology of the sale, or of
the interview between two people of equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
strength, a something which corresponds
very closely with "the move" in checkers.
This something gives a decided advantage to
the person securing it, and it is worth striving
for. This something is subtle and almost indescribable,
although apparent to every one
who has dealings with his fellow men. It
seems to be a matter of mental balance and
poise. The salesman, if he be well balanced
and poised, is "positive" to the buyer, the latter
being in a listening, and therefore passive,
attitude. So far the salesman has "the
move," which however he may later lose if
the prospect plays scientifically. Well, to get
back to the "waiting" stage, the prospect by
disturbing the salesman's poise, and "breaking
his nerve" by keeping him waiting on the
anxious bench in a state of suspense, often
manages to get "the move" on him, unless he
understands the psychology of the process and
accordingly avoids it. Suspense is the most
nerve-breaking mental state on the psychological
list, as all realize who have experienced
it. Beware of losing "the move."</p>

<p>An important factor in getting past the
stockade of the outer office is the conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>ness
of Self Respect and the realization of the
"I" of which we have spoken. This mental
attitude impresses itself upon those who
guard the outer works, and serves to clear the
way. As Pierce says: "Remember, you are
asking no favors; that you have nothing to
apologize for, and that you have every reason
in the world for holding your head high.
And it is wonderful what this holding up of
the head will do in the way of increasing
sales. We have seen salesmen get entrance
to the offices of Broadway buyers simply
through the holding of the head straight up
from the shoulders." But it is the Mental
Attitude back of the physical expression that
is the spirit of the thing&mdash;don't forget this.</p>

<p>The Mental Attitude and the physical expression
thereof instinctively influence the
conduct of other people toward one. We may
see the same thing illustrated in the attitude
and action of the street boy toward dogs. Let
some poor cur trot along with drooping ears,
timid expression, meek eyes, and tail between
his legs, and the urchin will be apt to kick
him or throw a rock at his retreating form.
Note the difference when the self-respecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
dog, with spirit in him, trots past, looking the
boy fearlessly in the eye and showing his
sense of self-respect and power to back it up
in every movement. That dog is treated accordingly.
There are certain people whose
manner is such that they do not need to ask
respect and consideration&mdash;it is given them
as a matter of right and privilege. People
stand aside to give them room, and move up
in street cars that they may have a seat. And
it does not necessarily follow that the person
to whom this respect is shown is a worthy individual
or a person of fine qualities&mdash;he
may be a confidence man or a swindler. But
whatever he is, or may be, he has certain outward
mannerisms and characteristics which
enable him to "put up a good front" and
which carry him through. At the back of it
all will be found certain mental states which
produce the genuine outward characteristics
and manner in the case of genuine instances of
persons possessing authority and high position,
the confidence man merely presenting a
passable counterfeit, being a good actor.</p>

<p>It is often necessary for the salesman to
send in a card to the inner office. It is well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
for him to have some cards, well engraved in
the most approved manner, bearing simply
his name: "Mr. John Jay Jones," with his
business appearing thereon. If he is travelling
from a large city, and is selling in
smaller towns, he may have "New York,"
"Chicago," "Philadelphia," "Boston," etc.,
as the case may be in the corner of his card.
If the name of his business appears on the
card the prospect often goes over the matter
of a possible sale, mentally, without the salesman
being present to present his case, and
then may decline to grant an interview. The
name, without the business, often arouses interest
or curiosity and thus, instead of hindering,
really aids in securing the interview.</p>

<p>Regarding the discussion of the business
with anyone other than the prospect himself,
the authorities differ. As a matter of fact it
would seem to depend largely upon the particular
circumstances of each case, the nature
of the articles to be sold, and the character
and position of the subordinate in question.</p>

<p>One set of authorities hold that it is very
poor policy to tell your business to a subordinate,
and that it is far better to tell him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
courteously but firmly that your business
is of such a nature that you can discuss it only
with the prospect in person. Otherwise, it
is held that the subordinate will tell you that
the matter in question has already been considered
by his principal, and that he is fully
informed regarding the proposition, and has
given orders that he is not to be disturbed
further regarding it.</p>

<p>The other set of authorities hold that in
many cases the subordinate may be pressed
into service, by treating him with great respect,
and an apparent belief in his judgment
and authority, winning his good-will and
getting him interested in your proposition,
and endeavoring to have him "speak about
it" to his superior during the day. It is
claimed that a subsequent call, the day following,
will often prove successful, as the
subordinate will have paved the way for an
interview and have actually done some work
for you in the way of influence and selling
talk. It is held that some salesmen have
made permanent "friends in camp" of these
subordinates who have been approached in
this way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>It would seem, however, as we have said,
to depend much upon the particular circumstances
of the case. In some cases the subordinate
is merely a "hold-off," or "breakwater;"
while in others he is a confidential
employee whose opinion has weight with the
prospect, and whose good-will and aid are
well worth securing. In any event, however,
it is well to gain the respect and good-will of
those in the "outer court," for they can often
do much in the way of helping or injuring your
chances. We have known cases in which subordinates
"queered" a salesman who had
offended them; and we have known other
cases in which the subordinate being pleased
by the salesman "put him next." It is always
better to make a friend rather than an
enemy&mdash;from the office-boy upward&mdash;on general
principles. Many a fine warrior has
been tripped up by a small pebble. Strong
men have died from the bite of a mosquito.</p>

<p>The following advice from J.F. Gillen, the
Chicago manager of the Burroughs Adding
Machine Company, is very much to the point.
Mr. Gillen, in the magazine "Salesmanship,"
says: "A salesman who has not proved his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
mettle&mdash;and who, unfortunately, is not sure
of himself&mdash;is likely to be overcome by a
sense of his own insignificance on entering
the private domain of the great man, rich
man, or influential man, from whom he hopes
to get an order. The very hum and rush of
business in this boss's office are very awe-inspiring.
The fact that there exists an iron-clad
rule, designed to protect the boss against
intrusion, forbidding the admittance of an
uninvited salesman&mdash;and the fact that the
army of employees are bound by this rule to
oppose the entrance of any such visitor&mdash;combine
to make an untried salesman morally
certain of his powerlessness; to make him
feel that he has no justifiable reason for presenting
himself at all. Indeed he has none,
if the awe which he feels for red-tape, rules,
dignitaries, has made him lose sight of the attractions
of his own proposition; has swallowed
up his confidence in what he has to
offer and his ability to enthuse the prospect in
regard to it. * * * If you believe that
your proposition will prove interesting to the
prospect and that he will profit by doing business
with you, you have a right to feel that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
the rule barring salesmen from his presence
was not intended to bar <i>you</i>. Convince yourself
of this and the stern negative of the information
clerk will not abash you. You will
find yourself endowed with a courage and resourcefulness
to cope with a slick secretary
who gives glibly evasive replies when you try
to find out whether Mr. Prospect is now in
his office, whether he cannot see you at once,
and what reason exists for supposing you
could possibly tell your business to any subordinate
in place of him. Once you are thus
morally sure of your ground, the hardest part
of the battle is won. * * * <i>You can see
the prospect and get speech with him, no matter
what obstacles intervene, if your nerve
holds out and you use your brains.</i>"</p>

<p>Remember this, always: The Psychology
of Salesmanship applies not only to work
with the prospect, but also to work with those
who bar the way to him. Subordinates have
minds, faculties, feelings and strong and
weak points of mentality&mdash;they have their
psychology just as their employer has his. It
will pay you to make a careful study of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
psychology&mdash;it has its rules, laws and principles.
This is a point often overlooked by
little salesmen, but fully recognized by the
"big" ones. The short cut to the mind of
many a prospect is directly through the mind
of the man in the outer office.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">THE PSYCHOLOGY OF PURCHASE</p>


<p>There are several stages or phases manifested
by the buyer in the mental process
which results in a purchase. While it is difficult
to state a hard and fast rule regarding
the same, because of the variety of temperament,
tendencies and mental habits possessed
in several degrees by different individuals,
still there are certain principles of feeling
and thought manifested alike by each and
every individual buyer, and a certain logical
sequence is followed by all men in each and
every original purchase. It follows, of
course, that these principles, and this sequence,
will be found to be operative in each
and every original purchase, whether that
purchase be the result of an advertisement,
display of goods, recommendation, or the
efforts of a salesman. The principle is the
same in each and every case, and the sequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
of the mental states is the same in each and
every instance. Let us now consider these
several mental states in their usual sequence.</p>

<p>The several mental states manifested by
every buyer in an original purchase are given
below in the order of sequence in which they
are usually manifested:&mdash;</p>

<p>We use the term "<i>original</i> purchase" in
this connection in order to distinguish the
original purchase from a repeated order or
subsequent purchase of the same article, in
which latter instance the mental process is
far more simple and which consists merely in
recognizing the inclination, or habit, and
ordering the goods, without repeating the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
original complex mental operation. Let us
now proceed to a consideration of the several
mental stages of the original purchase, in
logical sequence:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <i>Involuntary Attention.</i> This mental
state is the elementary phase of attention.
Attention is not a faculty of the mind, but is
instead the focusing of the consciousness
upon one object to the temporary exclusion of
all other objects. It is a turning of the mind
on an object. The object of attention may be
either external, such as a person or thing; or
internal, such as a feeling, thought, memory,
or idea. Attention may be either voluntary,
that is, directed consciously by the will; or
involuntary, that is, directed unconsciously
and instinctively and apparently independently
of the will. Voluntary attention is an
acquired and developed power and is the attribute
of the thinker, student and intellectual
individual in all walks of life. Involuntary
attention, on the contrary, is but little more
than a reflex action, or a nervous response to
some stimulus. As Halleck says: "Many
persons scarcely get beyond the reflex stage.
Any chance stimulus will take their attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
away from their studies or their business."
Sir William Hamilton made a still finer distinction,
which is, however, generally overlooked
by writers on the subject, but which is
scientifically correct and which we shall follow
in this book. He holds that there are
three degrees or kinds of attention: (1)
the reflex or involuntary, which is instinctive
in nature; (2) that determined by desire or
feeling, which partakes of both the involuntary
and voluntary nature, and which although
partly instinctive may be resisted by
the will under the influence of the judgment;
and (3) that determined by deliberate volition
in response to reason, as in study,
scientific games, rational deliberation, etc.</p>

<p>The first mental step of the purchase undoubtedly
consists of involuntary or reflex
attention, such as is aroused by a sudden
sound, sight, or other sensation. The degree
of this involuntary attention depends upon
the intensity, suddenness, novelty, or movement
of the object to which it responds. All
persons respond to the stimuli arousing this
form of attention, but in different degrees depending
upon the preoccupation or concen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>tration
of the individual at the time. The
striking or novel appearance of an advertisement;
the window-display of goods; the appearance
of the salesman&mdash;all these things
instinctively arouse the involuntary attention,
and the buyer "turns his mind on"
them. But this turning the mind on belongs
to Hamilton's first class&mdash;that of the instinctive
response to the sight or sound, and
not that aroused by desire or deliberate
thought. It is the most elemental form of
attention or mental effort, and to the salesman
means simply: "Well, I <i>see</i> you!" Sometimes
the prospect is so preoccupied or concentrated
on other things that he barely
"sees" the salesman until an added stimulus
is given by a direct remark.</p>

<p>II. <i>First Impression.</i> This mental state
is the hasty generalization resulting from the
first impression of the object of attention&mdash;the
advertisement, suggestion, display of
goods, or the Salesman&mdash;depending in the
last case upon the general appearance, action,
manner, etc., as interpreted in the light of
experience or association. In other words,
the prospect forms a hasty general idea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
the thing or person, either favorable or unfavorable,
almost instinctively and unconsciously.
The thing or person is associated
or classed with others resembling it in the
experience and memory of the prospect, and
the result is either a good, bad or indifferent
impression resulting from the suggestion of
association. For this reason the ad. man and
the window dresser endeavor to awaken
favorable and pleasing associated memories
and suggestions, and "puts his best foot
foremost." The Salesman endeavors to do
the same, and seeks to "put up a good
front" in his Approach, in order to secure
this valuable favorable first impression.
People are influenced more than they will
admit by these "first impressions," or suggestions,
of appearance, manner, etc., and the
man who understands psychology places
great importance upon them. A favorable
first impression smooths the way for the successful
awakening of the later mental states.
An unfavorable first impression, while it may
be removed and remedied later, nevertheless
is a handicap which the Salesman should
avoid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>Note</i>: The mental process of the purchase
now passes from the stage of <i>involuntary
attention</i>, to that of attention inspired
by desire and feeling which partakes of <i>both
the voluntary and involuntary elements</i>. The
first two stages of this form of attention are
known as Curiosity and Associated Interest,
respectively. In some cases Curiosity precedes,
in others Associated Interest takes the
lead, as we shall see. In other cases the manifestation
of the two is almost simultaneous.)</p>

<p>III. <i>Curiosity.</i> This mental state is
really a form of Interest, but is more elemental
than Associated Interest, being
merely the interest of novelty. It is the
strongest item of interest in the primitive
races, in children, and in many adults of elemental
development and habits of thought.
Curiosity is the form of Interest which is
almost instinctive, and which impels one to
turn the attention to strange and novel
things. All animals possess it to a marked
degree, as trappers have found out to their
profit. Monkeys possess it to an inordinate
degree, and the less developed individuals
of the human race also manifest it to a high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
degree. It is connected in some way with the
primitive conditions of living things, and is
probably a heritage from earlier and less secure
conditions of living, where inquisitiveness
regarding new, novel and strange sights
and sounds was a virtue and the only means
of acquiring experience and education. At
any rate, there is certainly in human nature
a decided instinctive tendency to explore the
unknown and strange&mdash;the attraction of the
mysterious; the lure of the secret things; the
tantalizing call of the puzzle; the fascination
of the riddle.</p>

<p>The Salesman who can introduce something
in his opening talk that will arouse
Curiosity in the prospect has done much to
arouse his attention and interest. The street-corner
fakir, and the "barker" for the
amusement-park show, understand this principle
in human nature, and appeal largely
to it. They will blindfold a boy or girl, or
will make strange motions or sounds, in order
to arouse the curiosity of the crowd and to
cause them to gather around&mdash;all this before
the actual appeal to interest is made. In
some buyers Curiosity precedes Associated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Interest&mdash;the interest in the unknown and
novel precedes the practical interest. In
others the Associated Interest&mdash;the practical
interest inspired by experience and association&mdash;precedes
Curiosity, the latter manifesting
simply as inquisitiveness regarding the
details of the object which has aroused Associated
Interest. In other cases, Curiosity
and Associated Interest are so blended and
shaded into each other that they act almost
as one and simultaneously. On the whole,
though, Curiosity is more elemental and
crude than Associated Interest, and may
readily be distinguished in the majority of
cases.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Associated Interest.</i> This mental
state is a higher form of interest than Curiosity.
It is a practical interest in things relating
to one's interests in life, his weal or
woe, loves or hates, instead of being the mere
interest in novelty of Curiosity. It is an acquired
trait, while Curiosity is practically an
instinctive trait. Acquired Interest develops
with character, occupation, and education,
while Curiosity manifests strongly in
the very beginnings of character, and before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
education. Acquired Interest is manifested
more strongly in the man of affairs, education
and experience, while Curiosity has its
fullest flower in the monkey, savage, young
child and uncultured adult. Recognizing the
relation between the two, it may be said that
Curiosity is the root, and Associated Interest
the flower.</p>

<p>Associated Interest depends largely upon
the principle of Association or Apperception,
the latter being defined as "that mental process
by which the perceptions or ideas are
brought into relation to our previous ideas
and feelings, and thus are given a new clearness,
meaning and application." Apperception
is the mental process by which objects
and ideas presented to us are perceived and
thought of by us in the light of our past experience,
temperament, tastes, likes and dislikes,
occupation, interest, prejudices, etc.,
instead of as they actually are. We see everything
through the colored glasses of our own
personality and character. Halleck says of
Apperception: "A woman may apperceive
a passing bird as an ornament to her bonnet;
a fruit grower, as an insect killer; a poet, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
a songster; an artist, as a fine bit of coloring
and form. The housewife may apperceive
old rags as something to be thrown away; a
ragpicker, as something to be gathered up.
A carpenter, a botanist, an ornithologist, a
hunter, and a geologist walking through a
forest would not see the same things." The
familiar tale of the text-books illustrates
this principle. It relates that a boy climbed
up a tree in a forest and watched the passers-by,
and listened to their conversation. The
first man said: "What a fine stick of timber
that tree would make." The boy answered:
"Good morning, Mr. Carpenter." The second
man said: "That is fine bark." The
boy answered: "Good morning, Mr. Tanner."
The third man said: "I'll bet there's
squirrels in that tree." The boy answered:
"Good morning, Mr. Hunter." Each and
every one of the men saw the tree in the light
of his personal Apperception or Associated
Interest.</p>

<p>Psychologists designate by the term "the
apperceptive mass" the accumulated previous
experiences, prejudices, temperament,
inclination and desires which serve to modify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the new perception or idea. The "apperceptive
mass" is really the "character" or
"human nature" of the individual. It
necessarily differs in each individual, by
reason of the great variety of experiences,
temperament, education, etc., among individuals.
Upon a man's "apperceptive mass,"
or character, depends the nature and degree
of his interest, and the objects which serve
to inspire and excite it.</p>

<p>It follows then that in order to arouse, induce
and hold this Associated Interest of the
prospect, the Salesman must present things,
ideas or suggestions which will appeal
directly to the imagination and feelings of the
man before him, and which are associated
with his desires, thoughts and habits. If we
may be pardoned for the circular definition
we would say that one's Associated Interest
is aroused only by interesting things; and
that the interesting things are those things
which concern his interests. A man's interests
always interest him&mdash;and his interests
are usually those things which concern his
advantage, success, personal well-being&mdash;in
short his pocketbook, social position, hobbies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
tastes, and satisfaction of his desires. Therefore
the Salesman who can throw the mental
spot-light on these interesting things, may
secure and hold one's Associated Interest.
Hence the psychology of the repeated statement:
"I can save you money;" "I can increase
your sales;" "I can reduce your
expenses;" "I have something very choice;"
or "I can give you a special advantage," etc.</p>

<p>It may as well be conceded that business
interest is selfish interest, and not altruistic.
In order to interest a man in a business
proposition he must be shown how it will
benefit him in some way. He is not running
a philanthropic institution, or a Salesman's
Relief Fund, nor is he in business for his
health&mdash;he is there to make money, and in
order to interest him you must show him
something to his advantage. And the first
appeal of Associated Interest is to his feeling
of Self Interest. It must be in the nature
of the mention of "rats!" to a terrier, or
"candy!" to a child. It must awaken pleasant
associations in his mind, and pleasing
images in his memory. If this effect is produced,
he can be speedily moved to the suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>ceeding
phases of Imagination and Inclination.
As Halleck says: "All feeling tends to
excite desire. * * * A representative
image of the thing desired is the necessary
antecedent to desire. If the child had never
seen or heard of <i>peaches</i> he would have no
desire for them." And, following this same
figure, we may say that if the child has a
taste for peaches he will be <i>interested</i> in the
idea of peaches. And so when you say
"peaches!" to him you have his Associated
Interest, which will result in a mental image
of the fruit followed by a <i>desire</i> to possess
it, and he will listen to your talk regarding
the subject of "peaches."</p>

<p>The following are the general psychological
rules regarding Associated Interests:</p>

<p>I. Associated Interest attaches only to
interesting things&mdash;that is to things associated
with one's general desires and ideas.</p>

<p>II. Associated Interest will decline in
force and effect unless some new attributes or
features are presented&mdash;it requires variety
in presentation of its object.</p>

<p>Macbain says: "One of the old time sales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>men
who used to sell the trade in the Middle
West, beginning some thirty years ago, and
following that vocation for several decades,
used as his motto, 'I am here to do you good.'
He did not make his statement general,
either, in telling his customers how he could
do it. He got right down to the vital affairs
which touched his customers. He demonstrated
it to them, and this personal
demonstration is the kind that makes the
sales."</p>

<p>Remember, always, that the phase of Associated
Interest in a purchase is not the same
as the phase of Demonstration and Proof.
It is the "warming up" process, preceding
the actual selling talk. It is the stage of
"thawing out" the prospect and melting the
icy covering of prejudice, caution and reluctance
which encases him. Warm up your
prospect by <i>general statements</i> of Associated
Interest, and blow the coals by positive,
brief, pointed confident statements of the
good things you have in store for him. And,
finally, remember that the sole purpose of
your efforts at this state is to arouse
in him the mental state of INTERESTED<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
EXPECTANT ATTENTION! Keep blowing
away at this spark until you obtain the
blaze of Imagination and the heat of Desire.</p>

<p>V. <i>Consideration.</i> This mental state is
defined as: "An examination, inquiry, or investigation
into anything." It is the stage
following Curiosity and Associated Interest,
and tends toward an inquiry into the thing
which has excited these feelings. Consideration,
of course, must be preceded and accompanied
by Interest. It calls for the phase of
Attention excited by feeling, but a degree of
voluntary attention is also manifested therewith.
It is the "I think I will look into this
matter" stage of the mental process of purchase.
It is usually evidenced by a disposition
to ask questions regarding the
proposition, and to "see what there is to it,
anyway." In Salesmanship, this stage of
Consideration marks the passing from the
stage of Approach on the Salesman's part,
to that of the Demonstration. It marks the
passage from Passive Interest to Active Interest&mdash;from
the stage of being "merely interested"
in a thing, to that of "interested
investigation." Here is where the real selling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
work of the salesman begins. Here is where
he begins to describe his proposition in detail,
laying stress upon its desirable points. In
the case of an advertisement, or a window display,
the mental operation goes on in the
buyer's mind in the same way, but without
the assistance of the salesman. The "selling
talk" of the advertisement must be stated or
suggested by its text. If the Consideration is
favorable and reveals sufficiently strong attractive
qualities in the proposition or
article, the mind of the buyer passes on to the
next stage of the process which is known as:</p>

<p>VI. <i>Imagination.</i> This mental state is
defined as: "The exercise of that power or
faculty of the mind by which it conceives and
forms ideal pictures of things communicated
to it by the organs of sense." In the mental
process of a purchase, the faculty of imagination
takes up the idea of the object in which
the Associated Interest has been aroused,
and which has been made the subject of Consideration,
and endeavors to picture the
object in use and being employed in different
ways, or as in possession of the buyer. One
must use his imagination in order to realize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
what good a thing will be to him; how he may
use it; how it will look; how it will sell; how
it will serve its purpose; how it will "work
out" or "make good" when purchased. A
woman gazing at a hat will use her imagination
to picture how she will look in it. The man
looking at the book will use his imagination
in picturing its uses and the pleasure to be
derived therefrom. The business man will
use his imagination to picture the probable
sale of the goods, their display, their adaptability
to his trade, etc. Another will picture
himself enjoying the gains from his purchase.
Imagination plays an important part in the
psychology of the sale. It is the direct inciter
of desire and inclination. The successful
salesman realizes this, and feeds the
flame of the imagination with the oil of Suggestion.
In fact, Suggestion receives its
power through the Imagination. The Imagination
is the channel through which Suggestion
reaches the mind. Salesmen and ad.
writers strive to arouse the imagination of
their prospective customers by clever word-painting.
The Imagination is the "direct
wire" to Desire. From Imagination it is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
short step to the next mental stage which is
called:</p>

<p>VII. <i>Inclination.</i> This mental state is
defined as: "A leaning or bent of the mind
or will; desire; propensity." It is the "want
to" feeling. It is the mental state of which
Desire is an advanced stage. Inclination has
many degrees. From a faint inclination or
bent in a certain direction, it rises in the
scale until it becomes an imperious demand,
brooking no obstacle or hindrance. Many
terms are employed to designate the various
stages of Inclination, as for instance: Desire,
wish, want, need, inclination, leaning,
bent, predilection, propensity, penchant,
liking, love, fondness, relish, longing, hankering,
aspiration, ambition, appetite, hunger,
passion, craving, lust, etc.</p>

<p>Desire is a strange mental quality, and one
very difficult to define strictly. It is linked
with feeling on one side, and with will on the
other. Feeling rises to desire, and desire
rises to the phase of will and endeavors to
express itself in action. Halleck says of Desire:
"<i>It has for its object something which
will bring pleasure or get rid of pain, imme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>diate
or remote, for the individual or for some
one in whom he is interested. Aversion, or a
striving to get away from something, is
merely the negative aspect of desire.</i>" Inclination
in its various stages is aroused
through the appeals to the feelings through
the imagination. The feelings related to the
several faculties are excited into action by a
direct appeal to them through the imagination,
and inclination or desired results. Appeal
to Acquisitiveness will result in a feeling
which will rise to inclination and desire for
gain. Appeal to Approbativeness will act likewise
in its own field. And so on through the
list, each well-developed faculty being excited
to feeling by the appropriate appeal through
the imagination, and thus giving rise to Inclination
which in turn strives to express itself
in action through the will.</p>

<p>In short, every man is a bundle of general
desires, the nature and extent of which are indicated
by his several faculties, and which result
from heredity, environment, training, experience,
etc. These desires may be excited
toward a definite object by the proper emotional
appeal through the imagination, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
by suggestion. Desire <i>must</i> be created or
aroused before action can be had, or the will
manifest in action. For, at the last, we do
things only because we "want to," directly or
indirectly. Therefore, the important aim of
the Salesman is to make his prospect "want
to." And in order to make him "want to" he
must make him see that his proposition is calculated
to "bring pleasure, or get rid of pain,
immediate or remote, for the individual or for
someone else in whom he is interested." In
business, the words "profit and loss" may be
substituted for "pleasure and pain," although
really, they are but forms of the latter. But
even when the prospect is brought to the
stage of strong inclination or desire, he does
not always move to gratify the same. Why is
this? What other mental process interferes?
Let us see as we pass on to the next stage of
the purchase, known as:</p>

<p>VIII. <i>Deliberation.</i> This mental state is
defined as: "The act of deliberating and
weighing facts and arguments in the mind,
calmly and carefully." Here is manifested
the action of thought and reason&mdash;the mental
process of weighing and balancing facts, feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>ings,
and inclinations. For it is not only <i>facts</i>
and <i>proofs</i> which are weighed in the mental
balance, but also feelings, desires, and fears.
Pure logical reasoning inclines to strict logical
processes based upon irrefragible facts, it
is true&mdash;but there is but little pure logical
reasoning. The majority of people are governed
more by their feelings and inclinations&mdash;their
loves and their fears&mdash;than by logic.
It has been said: "People seek not <i>reasons</i>,
but <i>excuses for following their feelings</i>."
The real deliberation, in the majority of cases,
is the weighing of probable advantages and
disadvantages&mdash;of various likes and dislikes&mdash;of
hopes and fears.</p>

<p>It is said that our minds are controlled by
<i>motives</i>&mdash;and the strongest motive wins. We
often find that when we think we desire a
thing ardently, we then find that we also like
something else better, or perhaps fear something
else more than we desire the first thing.
In such case, the strongest or most pressing
feeling wins the day. The faculties here exert
their different influences. Caution opposes
Acquisitiveness. Acquisitiveness opposes
Conscientiousness. Fear opposes Firmness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
And so on. The deliberation is not only the
weighing of facts, but also the weighing of
feelings.</p>

<p>The process of Deliberation&mdash;the weighing
of desires&mdash;the play and counterplay of motives&mdash;is
well illustrated by a scene in a classical
French comedy. "Jeppe," one of the
characters, has been given money by his wife
to buy her a cake of soap. He prefers to buy
a drink with the coin, for his inclinations tend
in that direction. But he knows that his wife
will beat him if he so squanders the money.
He deliberates over the pleasure to be derived
from the drink, and the pain which would
arise from the beating. "My stomach says
drink&mdash;my back says soap," says Jeppe. He
deliberates further. Then: "My stomach
says Yes! My back says No!" cries the poor
wight. The conflict between back and stomach
rages still more fiercely. Then comes the
deciding point: "Is not my stomach more to
me than my back? Sure, it is! I say <i>Yes</i>!"
cries Jeppe. And away to the tavern he
marches. It has been remarked that if the
active suggestion of the distant sight of his
wife armed with the cudgel, had been added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
to the situation, Jeppe would have bought the
soap. Or, if the tavern had not been so handy,
the result might have been different. Sometimes
a mental straw tips the scale. The
above illustration contains the entire philosophy
of the action of the mind in the process
of Deliberation. The salesman will do well
to remember it.</p>

<p>Halleck thus well states the immediate and
remote factors in choice: "The immediate
factors are * * * (1) a preceding process
of desire; (2) the presence in consciousness
of more than one represented object or
end, to offer an alternative course of action;
(3) deliberation concerning the respective
merits of these objects; (4) the voluntary fiat
of decision, which seems to embody most the
very essence of will. The remote factors are
extremely difficult to select. The sum total
of the man is felt more in choice than anywhere
else. * * * Before a second person
could approximate the outcome, he would
have to know certain remote factors, the principal
being: (1) heredity; (2) environment;
(3) education; (4) individual peculiarities."
This eminent authority might well have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
added an additional element&mdash;a most important
one&mdash;as follows: (5) SUGGESTION.</p>

<p>The Salesman watching carefully the shifting
scale of Deliberation, injects a telling
argument or suggestion into the scale, which
gives weight to his side at a critical stage.
He does this in many ways. He may neutralize
an objection by a counter-fact. He adds
another proof or fact here&mdash;a little more desire
and feeling there, until he brings down
the scale to a decision. It must be remembered
that this Deliberation is <i>not regarding</i>
the desirability of the proposition&mdash;the prospect
has admitted his desire, either directly
or indirectly, and is now engaged in trying to
justify his desire by reason and expediency.
He is seeking for reasons or "excuses" to
back up his desire, or perhaps, is endeavoring
to strike a balance of his conflicting desires
and feelings. His mental debate is not over
the question of desiring the goods, but over
the expediency and probable result of buying
them. It is the "to buy or not to buy" stage.
This is a delicate part of the process of the
purchase, and many prospects act like "see-saws"
during the process. The clever Sales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>man
must be ready with the right argument
at the right place. To him this is the Argumentive
Stage. Finally, if the Salesman's
efforts are successful, the balance drops, and
the process passes to the next stage, known
as&mdash;</p>

<p>IX. <i>Decision.</i> This mental stage is defined
as: "The mental act of deciding, determining,
or settling any point, question, difference,
or contest." It is the act of the <i>will</i>,
settling the dispute between the warring faculties,
feelings, ideas, desires and fears. It
is will acting upon reason, or (alas! too often,
upon mere feeling). Without entering into a
metaphysical discussion, let us remind you
that the practical psychology of the day holds
that "the strongest motive <i>at the moment</i>
wins the choice." This strongest motive may
be of reason or of feeling; conscious or unconscious;
but <i>strongest</i> at that moment it
must be, or it would not win. And this strongest
motive is strongest merely because of
our character or "nature" as manifested at
that particular moment, in that particular
environment, under the particular circumstances,
and subject to the particular sugges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>tions.
The choice depends more upon association
than we generally realize, and association
is awakened by suggestion. As Halleck
says: "It is not the business of the psychologist
to state what power the association of
ideas ought to have. It is for him to ascertain
what power it does have." And as
Ziehen says: "We cannot think as we will,
but we must think just as those associations
which happen to be present prescribe." This
being the case, the Salesman must realize that
the Decision is based always upon (1) the
mental states of the man at that moment; plus
(2) the added motives supplied by the Salesman.
It is "up to" the Salesman to supply
those motives, whether they be facts, proofs,
appeals to reason, or excitement of feeling.
Hope, fear, like, dislike&mdash;these are the potent
motives in most cases. In business, these
things are known as "profit or loss." All the
faculties of the mind supply motives which
aroused may be thrown into the balance affecting
decision. This is what argument,
demonstration and appeal seek to do&mdash;supply
motives.</p>

<p>(<i>Note</i>:&mdash;It might naturally be supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
that when the final stage of Decision has been
reached, the mental process of purchase is
at an end. But, not so. Will has three
phases: Desire, Decision, and Action. We
have passed through the first two, but Action
still is unperformed. A familiar example is
that of the man in bed in the morning. He
ponders over the question of rising, and
finally decides to get up. But action does not
necessarily result. The trigger of Action has
not been pulled, and the spring released. So
thus we have another mental state, known
as:&mdash;)</p>

<p>X. <i>Action.</i> This mental state is defined
as: "Volition carried into effect." Mill
says: "Now what is an action? Not one, but a
series of two things: the state of mind called
a volition, followed by an effect. The volition
or intention to produce the effect is one thing;
the effect produced in consequence of the intention
is another thing; the two together
constitute the action." Halleck says: "For
a completed act of will, there must be action
along the line of the decision. Many a decision
has not aroused the motor centers to
action, nor quickened the attention, for any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
length of time. There are persons who can
frame a dozen decisions in the course of a
morning, and never carry out one of them.
Sitting in a comfortable chair, it may take one
but a very short time to form a decision that
will require months of hard work. * * *
Some persons can never seem to understand
that resolving to do a thing is not the same as
doing it. * * * There may be desire, deliberation,
and decision; but if these do not
result in action along the indicated line, the
process of will is practically incomplete."
Many a person decides to do a thing but lacks
the something necessary to release the motive
impulses. They tend to procrastinate, and
delay the final act. These people are sources
of great care and work to the Salesman. Some
men can get their prospects to the deciding
point, but fail to get them to act. Others
seem specially adapted to "closing" these
cases. It requires a peculiar knack to "close"&mdash;the
effort is entirely psychological. We
shall consider it in a subsequent chapter
under the head of "Closing." To be a good
"closer" is the ambition of every Salesman,
for it is the best paid branch of his profes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>sion.
It depends largely upon the scientific
application of suggestion. To lead a prospect
to Action, is to pull the trigger of his will.
To this end all the previous work has been
directed. Its psychology is subtle. What
makes you finally get out of bed in the morning,
after having "decided to" several times
without resulting action? To understand
this, is to understand the process of the final
Action in the mind of the buyer. Is it not
worth learning?</p>

<p>In the succeeding chapters we shall consider
the several stages of the "Salesman's
Progress" toward a sale&mdash;the Approach, the
Demonstration, and the Closing. In these
stages of the Salesman, we shall see the action
and reaction upon the Mind of the Buyer,
along the lines of the Psychology of the Purchase.
In the Sale-Purchase the minds of
the Salesman and the Buyer meet. The result
is the Signed Order. The psychological
process of the Sale is akin to the progress of
a game of chess or checkers. And neither is
the result of chance&mdash;well defined principles
underlie each, and established methods are
laid down for the student.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="chap">THE APPROACH</p>


<p>Old salesmen hold that in the psychology
of the sale there is no more important stage
or phase than the introductory stage&mdash;the
stage of the Approach. Pierce says: "Experienced
salesmen will tell you that the first
five minutes in front of a prospect is worth
more than all the remainder in the matter of
getting the check. Why? Because it is then
that the prospect is forming his impressions
of you. Usually he is obliged to form this
quick size-up of the man he meets, in order to
conserve his time for important duties.
Therefore it is your duty to have this first impression
the best within your power. And the
best way to develop this is to be genuine."
But it must never be lost sight of that the
First Impression is solely for the purpose of
obtaining an entrance for the fine edge of
your wedge of salesmanship, which you must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
then proceed to drive home to its logical conclusion,&mdash;the
Order. An impression for impression's
sake is a fallacy. Remember the
old story of the Salesman who wrote in that
he was not making sales, but that he was
"making a good impression on my customers."
The firm wired back to him: "Go
out and make some more impressions&mdash;on a
snow bank." Do not lose sight of the real
object of your work, in obtaining the preliminary
results.</p>

<p>The National Cash Register Company instructs
its salesmen regarding the First Impression,
as follows: "Remember, the first
five minutes of speaking to a man is likely to
make or break you as far as that sale is concerned.
If you are in any way antagonistic or
offensive to him, you have hurt your chances
badly from the start. If you have failed to
definitely please or attract him, you have not
done enough. It isn't sufficient to be merely
a negative quantity. You should make a positive
favorable impression, and not by cajolery
nor attempted wit nor cleverness. The only
right way to gain a man's liking is to deserve
it. The majority of men do not often know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
just what the characteristics of a man are
which makes him pleasing or displeasing to
them; but they <i>feel</i> pleased or displeased,
attracted or repulsed, or indifferent, and the
feeling is definite and pronounced, even
though they cannot understand just what
makes it. A storekeeper in the smallest way
of business in a little country village is just
as susceptible of being pleased or offended as
any merchant prince. It should never be forgotten
that whatever his position may be, 'a
man's a man for a' that.'"</p>

<p>It is not so much what a man <i>says</i> when he
approaches the prospect, as the way he acts.
It is his manner, rather than his speech. And
back of his manner is his Mental Attitude.
Without going into subtle psychological theorizing,
we may say that it may be accepted
as a working hypotheses that a man radiates
his Mental State, and that those he approaches
feel these radiations. It may be the
suggestion of manner, or it may be something
more subtle&mdash;no use discussing theories here,
we haven't the time&mdash;the fact is that it acts
as radiations would act. This being recognized
it will be seen that the man's Mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Attitude in the Approach must be right. In
the previous chapters we have had much to
say to you regarding the factors which go to
create the Mental Attitude. Now is the time
to manifest what you have learned and practice&mdash;for
you are making the Approach.</p>

<p>Carry in mind Holman's catechism, of
which we have told you. Maintain your Self-Respect,
and remember that you are a MAN.
Pierce says of this: "One reason for this is
that self-respect is necessary in your work.
And self-respect cannot obtain where there
is lack of confidence either in your own ability
or in your line of goods. Assuming that you
take only such a line as you yourself can enthusiastically
endorse, it must be remembered
that your goods place you absolutely on a par
with the merchant. Hence, you talk to him
shoulder to shoulder, as it were. You are not
as a slave to a master! as a hireling to a lord;
as a worm to a mountain; although this is the
usual attitude untrained salesmen consciously
or unconsciously assume. They are timid.
They feel they might know their goods better.
They feel, perhaps, that the prospect knows
their goods or their competitors' goods bet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>ter
than they do themselves. Fear is written
all over their faces as the approach is made.
Nine-tenths of the fear is due to ignorance of
the goods. The other tenth is lack of experience."</p>

<p>Regarding this matter of Fear, we would
say that the experience of the majority of
men who have lived active and strenuous
lives, meeting with all sorts of people under
all sorts of circumstances, is that the cause
of Fear of people and things exists chiefly in
the imagination. It is the fear of anticipation
rather than the fear of actual conditions. It
is like the fear felt upon approaching a dentist's
office&mdash;worse than the actual experience
of the chair. Suspense and fearful expectation
are two of the great sources of
human weakness. Experience shows us that
the majority of things we fear never happen;
that those which do happen are never so bad
as we had feared. Moreover, experience
teaches us that when a real difficulty confronts
us, we usually are given the strength and
courage to meet and bear it, or to overcome it&mdash;while
in our moments of fearful anticipation
these helpful factors are not apparent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
Sufficient for the moment are the evils thereof&mdash;it
is not the troubles of the moment which
bear us down, but the burdens of future moments
which we have added to our load. The
rule is to meet each question or obstacle as it
arises, and not to add fear of trouble beyond
to the work of the moment. Do not cross your
bridge till you come to it. The majority of
feared things melt away when you come up to
them&mdash;they partake of the nature of the mirage.
It is the ghosts of things which never
materialize which cause us the greatest fear.
Banish Fearthought from your Mental Attitude
when you make the Approach.</p>

<p>But, a word of warning here: Do not become
"fresh" or impudent because you feel
Self Reliant and Fearless. While realizing
that <i>you</i> are a Man, do not forget that the
prospect is also one. Impudence is a mark
of weakness rather than of strength&mdash;strong
men are above this petty thing. Be polite and
courteous. The true gentleman is both self-respecting
and polite. And, after all is said
and done, the best Approach that a Salesman
can make is that of a GENTLEMAN. This
will win in the long run, and the consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
of having so acted will tend to strengthen the
Salesman and preserve his self-respect. Remember
not only to manifest the self-respect
of a gentleman&mdash;but also to observe the obligations
of politeness and courtesy which are
incumbent upon a gentleman. <i>Noblesse oblige</i>&mdash;"nobility
imposes obligations."</p>

<p>If you want a maxim of action and manner,
take this one: "Act as a gentleman should."
If you want a touchstone upon which to test
manner and action, take this: "Is this the
act of a gentleman?" If you will follow this
advice you will acquire a manner which will
be far superior to one based upon artificial
rules or principles&mdash;a natural manner&mdash;because
the manner of a gentleman is the expression
of true and pure courtesy, and will
be respected as such by all, whether they,
themselves, observe it or not. We have seen
many instances in which the maintenance of
the true gentlemanly spirit under strong
provocation has completely disarmed boorishness,
and won friendship and regard from
those apparently opposing it at the time.</p>

<p>The first psychological element of a Sale is
that of the First Impression upon the buyer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
And the impression must be of a favorable
kind. There must be nothing to create a bad
impression for this will distract the attention
from the purpose of the Approach to the particular
object awakening the unpleasant impression.
The first point preliminary to gaining
attention, is to know the name of the man
you are approaching; and if possible just
where he is. Nothing is more demoralizing
to the Salesman, and more likely to break up
the psychological influence of the Approach,
than a lack of knowledge of the name and
identity of the man you wish to see. The
miscarriage of an Approach occasioned by
mistaking the person should be avoided. If
you do not know your man, or where he is in
the office, it will be well to inquire of the others
present, politely of course, where "Mr. X's"
desk is. If you happen to ask this question
of "Mr. X" himself, you can easily adjust
yourself to the occasion. The <i>fiasco</i> of approaching
"Mr. A" and greeting him as
"Mr. X" is apt to be confusing and weakening,
and tends to bring the element of ridicule
into the interview, unless the Salesman
has the tact and wit to pass it off. If possible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
avoid asking for "the proprietor," or inquiring
of a man, "are you the proprietor?" If
you do not know the proprietor's name, ask
it of some one.</p>

<p>The National Cash Register people say to
their salesmen: "It is manifestly improper
to describe a definite form of words and require
salesmen to use them in all cases when
they approach business men at the first interview.
What would be proper to say to one
man under given circumstances might be unsuitable
to say to another under different circumstances.
Much must be left to the discretion
of the salesman. At the same time
there are certain leading statements to be
made, and certain ways of making them
which experience has shown to be well
adapted to the end in view. * * * It is
not necessary that this introductory talk
should be long. Often a short talk is more
convincing. We do not advise salesmen to
introduce themselves by sending in a card,
but prefer that they should depend wholly on
what they are able to say to secure a hearing.
We strongly disapprove of obscure introductions
and all tricks, and believe that a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
who has something worth saying, and is not
ashamed of his business, can make known his
errand in a bold, straightforward manner. A
salesman should adapt himself to his man,
but at the same time he should have a fixed
idea of what he has to say. He should be dignified
and earnest. * * * As soon as you
do succeed in reaching the proprietor, and
have said to him, 'Good morning! Is this Mr.
Johnson?' then say directly and plainly, 'I
represent the National Cash Register Company.'
This immediately puts you on a
square footing, and if he has anything to say
against your business it will draw his fire immediately.
If he has nothing to say, proceed
to business at once, but don't under any circumstances
say, 'I called to sell you a register,'
or 'I called to tell you about our registers,'
but put it rather in this way, '<i>I want to
interest you in our methods for taking care
of transactions with customers in your store</i>.'
The difference between the two ways of saying
it is that one begins with <i>your end</i> of the
business&mdash;the thing that interests <i>you</i>;
while the other begins at <i>his</i> end of it&mdash;the
thing presumably interesting to him."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>We specially direct the student's attention
to the above paragraph. It contains in a nutshell
the whole philosophy of the introductory
talk of the Approach. It is the essence of the
experience and knowledge of the thousands
of salesmen of the great selling organization
of the large concern named, and is right to the
point, and what is still more important, it is
scientifically correct, and based upon true
psychological principles.</p>

<p>The Salesman in making the Approach
should not act as if he were in a hurry, nor
should he dawdle. He should go about it in a
business-like manner showing his realization
of the value of time, and yet acting as if he
had the time necessary for the transaction of
that particular piece of business, just as he
would if the buyer had called on him instead
of vice versa. Don't swagger or strut, or act
as if you were the proprietor. Act the part of
the real business man who is at ease and yet is
attending to business. Do not try to "rush"
the customer in the Approach&mdash;you are calling
on him and must appear to defer to him
in the matter of opening the conversation, in
a respectful and yet self-respecting manner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
The better poised and balanced you are in
manner, the more he will respect you, no matter
how he may act. It is much easier for a
buyer to turn down an ill-bred boorish caller
than one who shows the signs of being a
gentleman. In fact the boorish caller invites
the turn-down&mdash;he suggests it by his manner;
while the gentleman suggests respectful treatment.
The line of least resistance in suggestion
is the one most natural for people to follow.</p>

<p>Some salesmen try to grasp the hand of the
customer at the beginning. This is all right
if the customer be a jovial "hale fellow, well
met" kind of a man, but if he be reserved and
dignified he will be apt to resent your pushing
this attention upon him. The thing to do
is to make him feel like shaking hands&mdash;this
is an important point, which counts if gained.
You can generally tell from his manner and
expression whether to extend your hand. You
must trust to your intuitions in "sizing up"
your man. What has been said regarding the
mind of the buyer will help you, and what data
you have collected will also be of use, but at
the last you must depend upon your own in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>tuition
to a considerable extent. Experience
develops this intuitive faculty. Some salesmen
thrust their cards into the hands of a
prospect when they introduce themselves.
This is poor psychology, for it serves to attract
the prospect's attention to the card and
away from the salesman. Introduce yourself
verbally, simply and distinctly, and then get
down to business.</p>

<p>If you see a man is busy with someone
else, or with something in particular&mdash;wait
for him. Don't break into his occupation,
until he looks up and gives you the psychological
signal to proceed. Never interrupt another
salesman who may be talking to the
prospect. This is not only a point in fair play
and business courtesy, but is very good business
policy in addition. When you begin your
introductory talk, get right to the point, and
don't beat around the bush as so many do.
Get down to business&mdash;get over the agony of
suspense&mdash;take the plunge. Remember always,
that to the prospect your little story is
not as stale or stereotyped as it may be to you&mdash;so
put earnestness into it, and tell it just as
if you were relating it for the first time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
someone who had requested it from you.
Maintain <i>your</i> interest, if you would arouse
that of the prospect.</p>

<p>Never commit the folly of asking a prospect:
"Are you busy?" or, "I fear you are
busy, sir?" This is a very bad suggestion
for the prospect, and makes it easy for him to
say "Yes!" You mould bullets for him to
fire at you. If he really <i>is</i> too busy to give
you the proper attention, you may do well to
tell him so, and then get out&mdash;but never suggest
anything of this kind to him if you expect
to proceed. It is akin to the doleful "You
don't want to buy any matches, sir, do you?"
of the forlorn vendors of small articles who
float into offices at times. Never make it easy
for a prospect to turn you down&mdash;or out. If
he is going to do these things, make him work
hard to do it. This might seem like needless
advice, but many young salesmen commit this
particular fault. Avoid the apologetic attitude
and manner&mdash;you have nothing to apologize
for. You are using up <i>your</i> time as much
as the prospect's time&mdash;let it go at that. Never
apologize for anything but a fault or mistake.
Your call is not a fault or a mistake&mdash;unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
you make it so by assuming it to be such.
Some men would like to apologize for being
alive, but they never make salesmen. Be
careful what adverse suggestions you may
put into the prospect's mind by this apologizing
and "explaining" business. What's the
use of this nonsense anyway&mdash;it never sold
any goods, and never will. It is merely a sign
of weakness and lack of nerve. Better stop it.</p>

<p>The trouble with these apologetic and
explanatory fellows is that they do not
thoroughly believe in the merit of their propositions.
If they really believed as they should&mdash;if
they had "sold themselves"&mdash;they would
realize that the prospect needs their goods,
and, that although he might not know it now,
he is being done a favor by having his attention
called to them. A Salesman has no need
to apologize to a customer, unless he has need
to apologize to himself&mdash;and if he is not right
on the latter score he had better change his
line and get something to sell that he is not
ashamed of, or get out of the business altogether.
No man ever feels ashamed of anything
in which he thoroughly believes and appreciates.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>The following advice from the National
Cash Register people, is like everything else
they say, very good: "Do not attempt to talk
to a man who is not listening, who is writing
a letter or occupying himself in any other
way while you are talking. That's useless,
and is a loss of self-respect and of his respect.
If he cannot give you his attention, say to
him: 'I see that you are busy. If you can give
me your attention for a few minutes I shall
be pleased; but I don't want to interrupt you,
if you cannot spare the time, and I will call
again.' Try to understand and feel thoroughly
the distinction between confidence and
familiarity. Never fail in respect either to
yourself or to the man with whom you are
talking. Never be familiar with him. Never
put your hand on his shoulder or on his arm,
nor take hold of his coat. Such things are repugnant
to a gentleman&mdash;and you should assume
that he is one. Never pound the desk
or shake your finger at a prospect. Don't
shout at him as if sound would take the
place of sense. Don't advance at him and
talk so excitedly under his nose that he
will back away from you for fear of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
run over, as if you were a trolley-car. I
have seen a sales agent back a prospect half
way across a room in this way. Don't compel
a man to listen to you by loud or fast talking.
Don't make him feel that he can't get a word
in edgewise and has to listen until you are out
of breath. This is not the sort of compulsion
to make customers. But make him believe that
you have something to say and will say it
quickly. Put yourself in his place from the
very start. Make him feel, not that you are
trying to force <i>your</i> business upon him, but
that you want to discuss how <i>his</i> business may
be benefited by you."</p>

<p>One of the best salesmen this particular
company ever had has passed down to the selling
corps of that concern the following axiom:
"If you do but one thing, in approaching a
prospect, say, '<i>It will save you money</i>,' seven
times, and you have made a good Approach."
And so say we. Concrete facts, stated in terse
terms, are the essence of the opening talk and
the life of the Approach.</p>

<p>What we have said so far has reference to
the stage of First Impression, which followed
the preliminary stage of Involuntary Atten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>tion
which was caused by your presence. The
purpose of the favorable First Impression is
to make the way easy for the real process of
selling which is to follow. The principle of
First Impression rests upon the associated
experience of the buyer, and its effect arises
from suggestion. The hasty, general idea or
impression of the Salesman's personality,
which we call the First Impression, is almost
unconscious on the part of the prospect, and is
due largely to the suggestion of association.
That is, the prospect has met other people
manifesting certain characteristics, and has
fallen into the habit of hasty generalization,
or classification of people in accordance with
certain traits of appearance, manner, etc.
This is the operation of the psychological
principle of the Association of Ideas, and may
be influenced by what is known as the Suggestion
of Association. The following quotation
from the volume of this series entitled
"Suggestion and Auto-Suggestion," will
make clearer this principle:</p>

<p>"This form of Suggestion is one of the
most common phases. It is found on all sides,
and at all times. The mental law of associa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>tion
makes it very easy for us to associate certain
things with certain other things, and we
will find that when one of the things is recalled
it will bring with it its associated impression.
* * * We are apt to associate
a well-dressed man, of commanding carriage,
travelling in an expensive automobile, with
the idea of wealth and influence. And, accordingly,
when some adventurer of the 'J.
Rufus Wallingford' type travels our way,
clad in sumptuous apparel, with the air of an
Astorbilt, and a $10,000 (hired) automobile,
we hasten to place our money and valuables
in his keeping, and esteem ourselves honored
by having been accorded the privilege."</p>

<p>The Suggestion of Authority also plays its
part in the First Impression, and in all the
stages of sale in fact. This form of suggestion
is described in the book just mentioned,
as follows: "Let some person posing as an
authority, or occupying a position of command,
calmly state a fallacy with an air of
wisdom and conviction, without any 'ifs' or
'buts,' and many otherwise careful people will
accept the suggestion without question; and,
unless they are afterward forced to analyze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
it by the light of reason they will let this seed
find lodgement in their minds, to blossom and
bear fruit thereafter. The explanation is
that in such cases the person suspends the
critical attention which is usually interposed
by the attentive will, and allows the idea to
enter his mental castle unchallenged, and to
influence other ideas in the future. It is like
a man assuming a lordly air and marching
past the watchman at the gate of the mental
fortress, where the ordinary visitor is challenged
and severely scrutinized; his credentials
examined; and the mark of approval
placed upon him before he may enter. * * *
The acceptance of such suggestions is akin to
a person bolting a particle of food, instead of
masticating it. As a rule we bolt many a bit
of mental provender, owing to its stamp of
real or pretended authority. And many persons
understanding this phase of suggestion
take advantage of it, and 'use it in their business'
accordingly. The confidence-man, as
well as the shrewd politician and the seller of
neatly printed gold-mines, imposes himself
upon the public by means of an air of authority,
or by what is known in the parlance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
busy streets as 'putting up a good front.'
Some men are all 'front,' and have nothing
behind their authoritative air&mdash;but that
authoritative air provides them with a living."</p>

<p>The suggestion of associated manner, appearance
and air&mdash;the "good front," in fact&mdash;is
the principal element in the favorable
First Impression. The balance is a mixture
of tact, diplomacy, common sense, and intuition.
But remember this always: the <i>best</i>
"front" is the <i>real</i> one&mdash;the one which is the
reflection of the right Mental Attitude and
Character&mdash;the "front" of the Gentleman.
If you lack this, the nearer you can act it out,
the better for yourself. But no imitation is
as good as the genuine article. The true
Gentleman is the scientific mixture of strength
and courtesy&mdash;the manifestation of "the iron
hand in the velvet glove." So much for the
First Impression.</p>

<p>The mental stages of Curiosity and Associated
Interest on the part of the buyer are also
to be induced by the Salesman in the Approach.
We have described these phases in
the chapter entitled "The Psychology of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Purchase," this particular part of which
should be re-read at this point. A few additional
words on these points, however, will
not be out of place here.</p>

<p>Regarding the phase of Curiosity, we
would say that it will be well if you can manage
the opening talk to the prospect so as to
"keep him guessing a little," while still holding
his Associated Interest. Curiosity whets
a man's interest just as Worcestershire sauce
whets his appetite. The key to the arousing
of Curiosity is the idea of "something new;"
a new idea; a new pattern, a new device, etc.
The mind of the average man likes "something
new"&mdash;even the old fogy likes something
new in his old favorites, new bottles for his
good old wine. The idea of newness and
novelty tends to arouse a man's inquisitiveness
and imagination. And if you can start
these faculties working you have done well,
for Associated Interest is closely allied thereto.
When you get a prospect to the stage of
asking questions, either verbally or mentally,
you have the game well started.</p>

<p>Never make the mistake of asking the man
if he "wants to <i>buy</i> so-and-so." Of course he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
doesn't at that stage, particularly if you ask
him in that way. It is too easy for him to say
No! It is almost as bad as that stock illustration
of adverse suggestion: "You don't want
to buy any so-and-so, do you mister?" which
brings a ready "No!" from the average person.
Nor do you want to say: "I have called
to see if I cannot sell you so-and-so, to-day,
Mr. X." Or, "Can I sell you some so-and-so,
this morning, Mr. Z?" This form of arousing
interest is based on erroneous psychological
principles. Of course, the prospect doesn't
want to buy or be sold at this stage of the game&mdash;the
sale is the finishing stage. This plan is
like cutting a log of wood with the butt-end
of the axe&mdash;you are presenting the wrong end
of the proposition. You can never arouse
Curiosity or Associated Interest in this way.
Forget the words "You buy" and "I sell" for
the moment&mdash;in fact the less you use them at
any stage the better it will be, for they are too
unpleasantly suggestive of the opening of
pocket-books to be agreeable to the prospect.
There are excellent substitutes for these terms&mdash;terms
which suggest profit, advantage, saving
and pleasure to the mind of the buyer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
rather than ideas of expenditure and "giving
up." Try to suggest the incoming stream of
money to your buyer&mdash;not the outgoing one.
The reason is obvious, if you understand the
laws of suggestion and psychology.</p>

<p>In short, let your appeal at this stage be
entirely to the Self Interest, Pleasure, and
Curiosity of the prospect. Try to get him
warmed up, and his imagination working. If
you can do this he will forget his other objects
of attention, and will lay aside his armor
of suggestive defence and his shield of instinctive
resistance to one whom he thinks
"wants to <i>sell</i> something" and open his
pocket-book. This is the stage in which you
must get in the sharp end of your psychological
wedge. Here is where you need the
keen edge of your axe&mdash;the butt-end may be
reserved for the Decision and Closing.</p>

<p>As far as possible, do not ask questions to
which the prospect can answer "No!" at this
stage. Fence him off on this point, and dodge
every sign of a forthcoming negative. But if
he does get out a "No!" or two&mdash;do not hear
him. Let his "No!" slip off like water from
a duck's back&mdash;refuse to admit it to your con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>sciousness&mdash;deny
it mentally&mdash;refuse the evidence
of your ears. This is no time for
"Noes"&mdash;go right ahead, unconscious of the
words. Keep on appealing to his Interest,
in the phases of Curiosity and Associated Interest.
Your aim here is to get the prospect
to the stage of Consideration. This stage is
indicated by his asking a question showing a
desire to know the particulars of your proposition.
The question may show but a shade
of interest, but it marks a move in the game.
It is the prospect's answering move to your
opening. It is an important psychological
moment in the game. The next move is yours!</p>

<p>And that move is on the plane of the Demonstration&mdash;for
the stage of the approach has
now been passed.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Before passing on to the consideration of
the stage of Demonstration, we desire to call
your attention to the following excellent advice
regarding the matter of rebuffs which are
so often met with in the stage of Approach.
It is from the pen of W.C. Holman, and appeared
in his magazine "Salesmanship." Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
Holman says: "A crack-a-jack salesman will
receive a rebuff as gracefully and easily and
with as little damage to himself as a professional
baseball player will take in a red-hot
liner that a batter drives at him, and go right
on playing the game as if nothing had happened.
An amateur salesman will want to
quit playing, or call the attention of the umpire
to the malicious intent of the batter. A
blow that would knock the ordinary man off
his pins will do nothing more than to give a
professional boxer a chance to show his agility
and win applause. If you drop a plank on
a cork in the water with a tremendous splash
the cork will bob up as serenely as if nothing
had happened, and lie quietly once more on
the unruffled surface of the water. And so a
clever salesman, when a smashing blow is
aimed at him by a surly prospect, will merely
sidestep gracefully and continue calmly with
the prosecution of his purpose. * * *
Self-control disarms all ill natured attacks."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="chap">THE DEMONSTRATION</p>


<p>In the last chapter we left the Salesman at
that stage of the Approach where the prospect
manifests enough interest to ask a question or
make an interrogative objection. This is an
important psychological point or stage in the
game, and here the Approach merges into the
Demonstration on the part of the Salesman;
and the stage of passive attention on the part
of the prospect merges into that of active attention,
discussion and Consideration. The
moment that the prospect ceases to be a passive
listener, and displays enough active interest
to ask a question or make an interrogative
objection, the great game of the sale is
on in earnest. The Demonstration has begun.</p>

<p>This stage of the sale closely resembles a
game of chess or checkers. The approach and
preliminary talk of the Salesman is the first
move in the game; the answer, question or ob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>jection
of the prospect is the second move&mdash;then
the real game or discussion is on. It is
now "up to" the Salesman to make his second
move, which is a reply move to that of the
prospect. And this particular move is a
highly important one in the great game of the
sale. Like an important early move in
checkers or chess the success or failure of
the whole game may depend on it, so it is well
to have this move mapped out as a part of
your preliminary study.</p>

<p>Macbain truthfully says of the first remark
of the prospect: "The customer is not going
to commit himself in response to the first remark.
He always holds considerable in reserve.
An objection&mdash;either expressed or implied&mdash;can
always be counted on. It may vary
from a general 'busy' statement, or 'no interest
in what is about to be submitted,' or it
may be a specific statement&mdash;even heated, in
fact&mdash;that the one approached has 'no time
for the salesman or his house.'"</p>

<p>But, just as in chess or checkers there are
certain "replies" indicated for every one of
the first few opening moves, all of which are
fully stated and explained in text books on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
these games, so in the great game of Salesmanship
there are certain replies indicated
for these preliminary moves on the part of the
prospect. The large selling concerns have
schools of instruction, personal or correspondence,
in which the Salesman is furnished with
the appropriate and logical answers to the objections
and questions usually advanced by
the prospect. It will be found that there are
really but few moves of this kind in the game
of the average prospects&mdash;they tend to say
the same things under the same circumstances,
and there is always an appropriate answer.
The salesman will acquire many of these
answers by experience, conversation with
older salesmen, or by instruction from his
sales-manager or the house. Each line has
its own stock of objections, and its own stock
of replies thereto.</p>

<p>There are two general classes of replies to
objections, which apply to nearly every kind
of proposition. The first is that of deftly
catching the objection on your mental fencing-foil,
allowing it to glance off, and at the same
time getting a thrust on your opponent.
President Patterson of the National Cash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
Register Company is credited with special
cleverness in this kind of reply, and his salesmen
are said to be instructed to listen carefully
to the prospect's objection and then to
turn it back on him by a remark based on the
principle of: "Why, that's the very reason
why you should," etc. In other words the objection
should be twisted into an argument in
favor of the proposition. In the hands of a
master this form of reply is very effective,
and often brings results by reason of its daring
and unexpectedness. But it is not every
one who has the skill to use it to advantage.</p>

<p>The second class of reply is based upon
what is called indirect Resistance, which, by
the way, is often the strongest form of <i>resistance</i>,
and accomplishes its intended effect
while avoiding the opposition and antagonism
of Direct Resistance. Some writers on the
subject have called this "Non-Resistance,"
obviously a misnomer for it is a form of resistance
although subtly disguised. It is analogous
to the tree that bends in order to avoid
breaking under the blasts of the storm; of
the flexible steel which bends to the pressure,
instead of breaking as would iron; but both of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
which spring back into place immediately. It
is generally very poor policy to directly oppose
the prospect upon minor points&mdash;the
main point is what you are after. And the
main point is the order&mdash;the rest is immaterial
and unimportant. Let us contrast
Direct-Resistance and Indirect-Resistance,
and see the points of each.</p>

<p>In Direct Resistance the minor objections
of the prospect are met with the answer:
"You are wrong there, Mr. X;" or, "You are
entirely mistaken;" or, "You take the wrong
view;" or, as we heard in one instance: "Your
objection is ridiculous." The Direct Resistance
is necessary in a few contingencies, or
upon rare occasions, but it should be sparingly
and cautiously used. It is a desperate remedy
indicated only for desperate diseases. The
Indirect Resistance expresses itself in answers
of: "That is possibly <i>true</i> in some
cases, <i>but</i>," etc.; or, "There is <i>much</i> truth in
what you say, Mr. X, <i>but</i>," etc.; or, "As a
general proposition that is probably correct,
<i>but</i>," etc.; or, "I quite agree with you, Mr.
X. that (etc.) but in this particular case I
think an exception should be made," etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
The value of this form of resistance lies in
the fact that it costs you nothing to allow the
prospect to retain his own ideas and entertain
his own prejudices, provided they do not interfere
with the logic of your general argument,
nor affect your main point, the order.</p>

<p>You are not a missionary or a pedagogue&mdash;you
are just a Salesman and your business is
to <i>take orders</i>. Let the old fellow keep his
foolish ideas and intolerant prejudices, providing
you can steer him straight to the ordering
point. The active principle in Indirect
Resistance is to get rid of his general objections
in the easiest and shortest way, by allowing
him to retain them, and concentrating
your and his attention and interest upon the
particular points of your proposition&mdash;the
positive and material points of your particular
case. Avoid disputes on non-essentials, generalities,
and immaterial points. You are
not striving for first prize in debate&mdash;<i>you're
after orders</i>. Remember the legal principles
of the "pertinent, relevant, and material"
points, and side-track the "immaterial, irrelevant
and impertinent" side-issues, even if
you have to tacitly admit them in Indirect Re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>sistance.
Here it is in a nutshell: <i>Sidetrack
and Sidestep the Non-Essentials</i>.</p>

<p>The Salesman has now reached the point
in which the prospect is manifesting the psychological
stage of Consideration&mdash;the stage
in which he is willing to "look into" the matter,
or rather into the subject or object of the
proposition. This stage must not be confused
with that of Deliberation, in which the prospect
weighs the pros and cons of whether he
should purchase. The two stages are quite different.
The present stage&mdash;that of Consideration&mdash;is
merely the phase of examination, investigation
or inquiry into the matter, to see
if there is really anything of real practical interest
in it for himself. It is more than mere
Associated Interest, for it has passed into
the manifestation of interested investigation.
In many cases the process never gets beyond
this stage, particularly if the Salesman does
not understand the psychology of the process.
Many salesmen make the mistake of trying to
make their closing talk at this point&mdash;but this
is a mistake. The prospect must understand
something about the details of the proposition,
or the qualities and characteristics of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
the goods, before he uses his imagination or
feels inclination to possess the thing. So here
is where the work of explanation comes in.</p>

<p>The term "Demonstration" has two general
means, each of which is exemplified by
stages in the Salesman's work of Demonstration.
The first meaning, and stage, is: "A
showing or pointing out; an indication, manifestation
or exhibition." The second meaning,
and stage, is: "The act of proving clearly,
by incontrovertible proof and indubitable
evidence, beyond the possibility of doubt or
contradiction." The first stage is that of
"showing and pointing out"&mdash;the second, that of
of "proof." The first is that of presenting
the features of a thing&mdash;the second, that of
logical argument and proof. And, therefore,
remember that you are now at the stage of
"showing and pointing out," and not that of
"argument and proof."</p>

<p>Regarding the matter of "showing and
pointing out" the features and characteristics
of your goods or proposition, you should always
remember that the prospect does not
know the details of your proposition or article
of sale as you do&mdash;or as you <i>should</i> know.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
The subject is not "stale" to him, as it may
have become to you if you have not kept up
your enthusiasm. Therefore, while avoiding
needless waste of time, do not make the mistake
of rushing this point of the demonstration
and thus neglecting the important features.
Better one feature well explained and
emphasized, than a score hurried over in a
sloppy manner. It is better to concentrate
upon a few leading and striking points of
demonstration, of material interest to the
prospect, and to assume that he does not know
anything about them except as he may show
his knowledge by questions or objections&mdash;all
this in a courteous manner, of course, avoiding
the "know it all" air. The prospect must
have time to allow the points to sink into his
mind&mdash;some men are slower than others in
this respect. Watch the prospect's face to see
by his expression whether or not he really
understands what you are saying. Better
present one point in a dozen ways, to obtain
understanding, than to present a dozen points
in one way and fail to be understood.</p>

<p>In order to demonstrate your goods or
proposition at this stage, you must have fully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
acquainted yourself with them, and also have
arranged the telling points in a natural and
logical order of presentation, working from
the simple up to the complex. Be careful not
to suggest <i>buying</i> at this point, lest your prospect
take fright and lose interest in the demonstration.
He is naturally in a defensive mood,
for he scents the appeal to his pocket book in
the distance&mdash;you must try to take his mind
off this point by arousing his interested attention
in the details of your goods or proposition.
Explain the details just as you would
if the prospect had called upon you for the
purpose of investigation. In fact, if you can
work yourself up to the proper Mental
Attitude you may effect the psychological
change by which the positions may be reversed,
and so that it will instinctively seem
to the prospect that he is calling on you and
not you on him. There is an important psychological
point here which you would do well
to remember. The man who is called upon
always has "the move" on the caller&mdash;if you
can reverse this psychological condition, you
have gained a great advantage. An awakened
personal interest in the details of a proposi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>tion,
on the part of the prospect, tends to reverse
the conditions.</p>

<p>If you would understand what a scientific
demonstration of an article or proposition is
like, it would pay you to listen to the demonstration
by a well-trained salesman of the
National Cash Register Company. This company
drills its salesmen thoroughly in this
part of their work, until they have every detail
fastened in their minds in its proper logical
order. An old salesman of this company
should be able to repeat his formula backwards
as well as in the regular order&mdash;beginning
at the middle and working either backward
or forward, at will. He understands
the "why" and "what for" of every detail of
his article and proposition, and is taught to
present them in their logical order. Listening
to a talk of one of their best salesmen is
a liberal education in demonstration.</p>

<p>The essence of this stage of the demonstration
is that it should be given in the spirit of
a conversational recital of an interesting
story, or description of an event. Speak in an
impersonal way; that is, avoid suggesting to
the prospect that you are trying to sell him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
the thing. Let this part of your talk be given
from the sheer enthusiasm inspired in your
mind by the merits of your proposition. Let
it be a labor of love&mdash;forget all about your
hope of sale or profit. Your one aim and object
of life, at that moment, should be that of
inspiring the prospect with the wonderful
merits of your proposition, which you yourself
entertain. Yours should be the spirit
of the propogandist seeking converts&mdash;imparting
information for the good of others,
and "for the cause." Forget the forthcoming
collection plate, in the earnestness of your
sermon.</p>

<p>The National Cash Register Company instructs
its salesmen as follows regarding this
stage of the demonstration: "When you have
gotten a prospect to a demonstration you have
accomplished a most important step. You
can take it for granted that he is to some extent
interested in the subject. Now, by all
means make the most of that opportunity. Say
what you have to say to him thoroughly and
carefully. Don't rattle off your demonstration
in a hurry, as if you were wound up and
had to say so many words to the minute. Give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
him a chance to speak, to ask questions or
make objections. He probably has certain
ideas in his mind which may be a decided
help or a decided hindrance to your argument.
You ought to learn what they are. Don't
imagine because he listens in silence that he
agrees with you, or even understands all you
say. Speak deliberately. If you see from a
puzzled or doubtful look on his face that anything
is not quite plain to him, stop and make
it plain. Take time enough to explain each
point thoroughly. Whenever you make a
statement that is open to question, be sure to
get his assent to it before you proceed. If he
will not assent to it exactly as you make it,
modify it until he does. Get him to assent in
some degree to every proposition you make, so
that when you get to the general result he
cannot go back and disagree with you. Don't
do this however as if you were trying to corner
him, but with a simple desire to reach a
reasonable basis of argument. Cast aside all
attempts at being a clever talker, all idea that
there is any trick of words or manner, any
secret artfulness about selling registers, and
put yourself in the plain, unaffected spirit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
a man who has simply a truth to tell, and
is bent upon telling it in the plainest, homliest
way. Avoid above all things the fatal mistake
of demonstrating to your prospect with
a sense of fear, haste, and uncertainty.
Realize fully the power of the facts behind
you, and have the full confidence of your convictions;
coolly and deliberately make each
point clear and conclusive, and lead the prospect
by simple steps up to absolute conviction."</p>

<p>If you have held your prospect's interested
attention during this stage of the Demonstration,
you will find that his imagination is beginning
to work in the direction of making
mental pictures of how the thing or proposition
would work for him&mdash;how the article
would look in his possession. It is a psychological
law that interested investigation, or
consideration, tends to awaken the interest of
imagination and desire if the object of the investigation
blends with the general trend of
the person's thought and feelings. The very
process of investigation inevitably brings to
light new points of interest. And, then, the
act of investigation and discovery, instinctive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>ly
creates a feeling of proprietorship in the
thing investigated or discovered. It establishes
an association between the object and
its investigator.</p>

<p>Halleck says: "* * * We must not forget
that any one not shallow and fickle can
soon discover something interesting in most
objects * * * the attention which they
are able to give generally ends in finding a
pearl in the most uninteresting looking oyster.
* * * The essence of genius is to present
an old thing in new ways." And again:
"When we think about a thing, or keep the
mind full of a subject, the activity in certain
brain tracts is probably much increased. As
a result of this unconscious preparation, a full
fledged image may suddenly arise in consciousness."
Hoffding says: "The inter-weaving
of the elements of the picture in the
imagination takes place in great measure below
the threshold of consciousness, so that
the image suddenly emerges in consciousness
complete in its broad outlines, the conscious
result of an unconscious process." Halleck
also says: "A representative image of the
thing desired is the necessary antecedent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
desire. Not until a representative idea comes
to the mind does desire arise. It has often
been said that where there is no knowledge
there can be no desire. A child sees a new toy
and wants it. A man notices some improvements
about his neighbor's house and wishes
them. One nation finds out that another has
a war ship of a superior model, and straightway
desires something as good or better. A
scholar sees a new cyclopedia or work of reference,
and desire for it arises. A person
returns and tells his friends how delightful a
foreign trip is. Their desires for travel increase.
Knowledge gives birth to desire, and
desire points out the point to will." In this
paragraph we have quoted eminent authorities,
showing the direct line of psychological
progress from interested investigation,
through imagination, to desire and will. One
investigates and gains favorable knowledge
regarding a subject; then his imagination
operates to show him the possibility of its successful
application to his personal case; then
his desire for the thing is awakened.</p>

<p>The stage of Imagination is reached when
the prospect begins to think of the thing or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
proposition in connection with himself. He
then begins to picture it in its application to
his needs or requirements, or in relation to
his general desires, tastes and feelings. The
Salesman, in order to awaken the Imagination
of the prospect, should endeavor to paint
"word pictures" of the thing in its workings,
application, value, and utility. He should endeavor
to make the prospect <i>see</i>, mentally,
the desirability of the thing to any man&mdash;how
it will work for good; how it will benefit one;
how great an advantage it will be for one;
how much good it will be in every way for its
possessor. Avoid the personal application,
even at this late stage&mdash;make the application
general, so as to avoid scaring off the prospect's
pocket book. The whole idea and aim
of this stage of the process of sale is to awaken
inclination in the prospect&mdash;to make his mouth
water for the thing&mdash;to make him begin to
feel that he would like to have it, himself.
He must be put into the mental condition of
the woman gazing longingly at the hat in the
milliner's window; or of the boy who is peeking
through the knot-hole in the fence of the
base-ball park. He must be led into the feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>ing
that he is on the outside of the fence or
window&mdash;and the good thing is inside. He
will then begin to feel the inclination or desire
to "get on the inside."</p>

<p>We once heard a tale of two Southern
darkies, which illustrates this point. The two
were riding on the same mule's back coming
home from work. The foremost darkey began
relating the story of some roast possum he
had feasted upon the preceding night. He
pictured the possum as fat and tender; how
they first "briled" him, and then roasted him
in the oven; how juicy and brown he looked;
how nice he smelt; how he was served up
"wid coon-gravy poured all over him;" and
finally how nice he tasted when the narrator
dug his teeth into him. The darkey in the rear
displayed increasing signs of uneasiness as
the tale proceeded and as he imagined first
the sight, then the smell, and then the <i>taste</i> of
the possum. Finally he groaned, and shouted
out: "Shet up, yer fool nigger! Does yer
wanter make me fall clean offen dis yer
mewel?" This is the point&mdash;you must make
your prospect see, smell and taste the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
possum you have, until he is ready to "fall
offen de mewel."</p>

<p>Words describing action, taste, feelings, or
in fact anything which relates to sense perceptions,
tend to arouse the imagination. If
the Salesman cultivates the art of actually
seeing, tasting or feeling the thing in his
own imagination, as he talks, he will tend to
re-produce his mental pictures in the mind of
his prospect. Imagination is contagious&mdash;along
the lines of suggestion. Descriptions of
sensations, or feelings, tend to awaken a
sympathetic response and representation in
the minds of others, along the lines of suggestion.
Did you never have your imagination
and desire fired by the description of a
thing&mdash;didn't you want to see, feel, or taste
it yourself? Did you never <i>feel</i> the effect of
words like: "delicious; fragrant; luscious;
sweet; mild; invigorating; bracing," etc., in
an advertisement? How many young people
have been hurried into matrimony by an illustration
or word-picture of a "happy
home;" "a little wife to meet you at the
door;" "little children clustering around
you," and all the rest of it? A well known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
instalment furniture dealer of Chicago is said
to be psychologically responsible for thousands
of weddings, by his suggestive pictures
of the "happy home" and his kind statement
that "We will Feather your Nest;" and "You
find the Bride, and we will do the rest." The
Salesman who can "paint bright pictures in
the mind" of his prospect, will succeed in
awakening the Imagination, and arousing the
Inclination and Desire. Newman well said:
"Deductions have no power of persuasion.
The heart is commonly reached, not through
the reason, but through the imagination.
* * * Persons influence us, voices melt us,
looks subdue us, deeds inflame us."</p>

<p>And so we pass to the stage of Inclination
or Desire, by the road of the Imagination.</p>

<p>The mental state of Inclination, or Desire,
following upon the arousing of the appropriate
faculties through the Imagination
which arises in the stage of Consideration,
may be briefly described as the <i>feeling of</i>:
"This seems to be a good thing&mdash;<i>I would like
to have it</i>." This Inclination has been aroused
by demonstration and suggestion, and the
prospect begins to experience the feeling that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
the possession of the thing will add to his
pleasure, comfort, well-being, satisfaction or
profit. You will remember the statement regarding
Desire given in a previous chapter:
"<i>Desire has for its object something which
will bring pleasure or get rid of pain, immediate
or remote, for the individual or for
some one in whom he is interested. Aversion,
or a striving to get away from something, is
merely the negative aspect of desire.</i>" It is
this feeling that you have aroused in some degree
in the mind of the prospect. You have
brought him to the first stages of Inclination,
which naturally brings him to a deliberation
as to whether he is justified in purchasing it,
and to the point where he will begin to weigh
the advantages and disadvantages of the purchase&mdash;the
question of whether he is willing to
"pay the price" for it, which is, after all, the
vital question in nearly all forms of deliberation
following Inclination and Desire. But as
the prospect's mind passes to the stage of
Deliberation, you must not lose sight of the
question of Desire, for it may be necessary to
re-kindle it in him, or to blow upon its sparks,
when he debates the "to buy or not to buy."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
The Deliberation is largely a question of a
conflict of motives, and Desire is a powerful
motive&mdash;so you must be ready to arouse a
new phase of "want to" in the prospect to
counterbalance some other motive which may
be turning the scales in the other direction.</p>

<p>In entering into the stage of Deliberation,
or Argument, the discussion passes from the
impersonal plane to the personal. The question
no longer is: "Is not this a good thing?"
to that of "Should you not have it for your
own?" This is a distinct change of base, and
a different set of faculties are now employed
by the Salesman. He leaves the Descriptive
phase and enters into that of Argument. He
enters into that second meaning or phase of
Demonstration which has been defined as:
"Proving clearly." And the question of
proof and argument is that of whether the
prospect is not justified in acquiring the thing.
The prospect's mind is already considering
the two sides of the question, his Caution combating
his Inclination. He is like "Jeppe" of
whom we told you in a previous chapter.
It is now a question of "my back or my
stomach," with him. The Salesman's busi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>ness
now is to demonstrate to him that he can
and should acquire the thing. This is a proceeding
in which the Salesman's tact, resources,
knowledge of human nature, persuasive
power, and his logic are needed.</p>

<p>The Salesman has an advantage here which
he often overlooks. We refer to the fact that
the very objections of the prospect, and his
questions give a key to his mental operations,
which may be followed up by the Salesman.
He knows now what is on the prospect's mind,
and what are his general feelings, views, and
inclinations regarding the matter. When he
begins to talk he gives you a glimpse at his
motives, prejudices, hopes and fears. It is
quite an art to lead the prospect to ask the
questions or to make the objections to which
you have a strong answering argument. You
then are able to turn back upon him his own
argument. <i>It is a psychological fact that the
force of a statement made in answer to an interrogative
objection, is much stronger than
would be the same statement made without
the question or objection.</i></p>

<p>Macbain says: "Lincoln, it is related, early
learned in beginning the study of law, that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
did not know what it was to prove a thing.
By means of careful, conscientious study, in
which he took up the problems of Euclid, one
by one, he satisfied himself that he then
realized absolutely what it meant to prove a
proposition. One of the most eminent judges
of the Iowa judiciary regards every legal
problem as a proposition to be proved by a
chain of reasoning. The salesman who determines
with absolute accuracy what it
means, first, to prove a proposition, and
second to apply the general principles of
demonstration to an immediate matter in
hand, knows just how far to go in making his
demonstration, what to include and what to
exclude. He can see in his mind's eye the
chain of evidence that he is fashioning and
will make that fabric of his mind exact, logical
and convincing."</p>

<p>(Note:&mdash;In order to train the student in
logical thinking, development of the logical
faculties, and the art of expressing one's
thoughts in a logical and effective manner,
we would suggest that he make inquiry regarding
the volumes of the present series
known as "The Art of Logical Thinking, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
The Laws of Reasoning;" "Thought-Culture,
or Practical Mental Training;" and "The
Art of Expression." These books are published
by the house issuing the present volume.)</p>

<p>It will be seen that the field of discussion in
this stage of Deliberation covers not only the
subject of the value and utility of the goods
or proposition, but also the question of the
price, the advisibility of the purchase at this
time, the special advantages possessed, the
over-balancing of assumed disadvantages, and
in fact the whole question of purchase from
beginning to end. The one thing to be held
in the mind of the Salesman, however, is
"<i>This will do you good; this will do you good;
this will do you good!</i>" Keep hammering
away at this one nail, in a hundred ways&mdash;hold
it up to view from a hundred viewpoints
and angles. It is the gist of the whole argument,
at the last. Don't allow yourself to be
sidetracked from this essential proposition,
even if the argument spreads itself over a
wide field. The point is that (1) <i>the thing is
good</i>; (2) <i>the prospect needs it</i>; and (3) <i>that
you do him a good turn by making him see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
that he needs it</i>. We once knew of a very successful
life-insurance salesman who had but
two points to his selling talk. These were:
(1) "Life insurance is a necessity;" and (2)
"My company is sound." He brushed aside
all other points as immaterial, and insisted
with all his heart and soul upon his two points.
He was not an educated man, nor was he
versed in the technicalities of life-insurance,
but he knew his two points from cellar to
garret. He outsold many men with actuarial
minds, and extended knowledge. He followed
the "rifle-ball" policy, instead of the "shot
gun" plan. When he struck the target, he
made a mark!</p>

<p>It is the Mental Attitude of the Salesman
which is the power behind his argumentive
rifle-balls. It is his enthusiasm which warms
up the prospect's imagination and desire.
And, back of these, must always be his belief
in his own proposition. The Salesman must
"sell himself" over and over again, as friend
Holman has suggested. He must answer
every objection which occurs to himself, as
well as those which are thrust upon him in his
work. If the goods are right, there must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
an answer to every objection, just as there
is a return-move to every move in chess&mdash;just
as there always is "the other side" to
everything. He must find this move, and this
"other side" to every objection to which his
proposition is open. And he must "sell himself"
over and over again, as we have said.
The National Cash Register people say to
their salesmen: "Selling registers is a
straight-forward serious work. You have a
plain statement to make of the facts which
you are convinced are true, and which you
are certain it is for the prospect's benefit to
know. You should be as sincere about it as
if you were a clergyman preaching the gospel.
If you go at it in this sincere spirit the prospect
will feel the importance of what you say,
and it will carry its due weight. It is a fact
which you must fully believe, that the register
is a great benefit to any man who buys it; that
it will save any merchant many times its cost
while he is paying for it."</p>

<p>Pierce says: "So in selling&mdash;it is absolutely
essential to be genuine. First, last and
foremost&mdash;be genuine. Practice absolutely
what you preach. Be honest. Never under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>take
a line of goods that you cannot enthusiastically
endorse. Otherwise you cannot
'sell yourself.' And selling one's self is by
all means necessary. Students have asked
us: 'How about being honest when the customer
asks you a question that you know in
your heart you cannot answer straight-forwardly?'
The answer is: Drop that line;
<i>the sooner the better</i>."</p>

<p>It is true that there are men who "wear the
livery of heaven in which to serve the devil,"
and who practice self-hypnotization upon
themselves until they get to actually believe
that they are advocating an honest proposition
in place of the "fake" they are proposing.
And many of these "confidence-men" and
"green-goods men" throw themselves so
earnestly into their acting that they persuade
their victims by reason of their earnestness.
We remember Bulwer's tale of the French
beggar whose tears wrought havoc upon the
hearts of his susceptible victims. "How are
you able to weep at will?" he was asked. "I
think of my poor father who is dead," he answered.
Bulwer adds: "The union of sentiment
with the ability of swindling made that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
Frenchman a most fascinating creature!"
But every genuine thing must have its
counterfeit&mdash;the existence of the latter only
serves to prove the former. The success of
the "J. Rufus Wallingford's" of real life, are
more than equaled by their final downfall.
No man can continue to prostitute his talents
and be happy, or even ultimately successful.
The Law of Compensation is in full operation.
No, we're not preaching&mdash;just indulging
in a little philosophy, that's all!</p>

<p>Let us now proceed to the stage of the Salesman's
Closing, and the prospect's Decision
and Action.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="chap">THE CLOSING</p>


<p>The "Closing" is a stage of the sale that is
an object of dread to the majority of salesmen.
In fact some salesmen content themselves
with leading the prospect to the point
bordering on Decision and Action, and then
lose heart, leave the prospect, and later bring
around the sales manager or special "closer"
for the concern. They can lead the horse to
the trough, but they cannot make him drink.
While it is true that the stage of Closing is
a delicate one, and involving as it does some
practical psychological strategy, nevertheless
we are of the opinion that many salesmen are
victims of their own adverse auto-suggestions
in this matter&mdash;they make a boogaboo of the
thing which is often found to be but lath and
plaster instead of solid iron and granite.
Many a salesman is defeated in his Closing
by his own fears rather than by the prospect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
This stage of the sale is one in which the Salesman
should draw on his reserve store of enthusiasm
and energy&mdash;for he needs it in order
to carry the day. As Holman once wrote:
"General Grant said that in almost every
battle, after hours of fighting, there came a
critical moment in which both parties were
tired out, and the side that braced up at that
moment and pounded hard would win. This
is probably so in selling. A good salesman
knows that critical moment, and pounds."</p>

<p>The main cause of the failure to bring the
prospect to a favorable Decision&mdash;the first of
the two final stages of the Closing&mdash;is that
the Salesman has not done his best work in
the preliminary stages of the Demonstration.
He has not demonstrated the proposition
properly, or has not awakened the Imagination
and Inclination of the prospect to a sufficient
extent. Many salesmen slight the preliminary
process of the Demonstration in their
anxiety to reach the Closing&mdash;but this is a
great mistake, for no structure is stronger
than its foundation. The Closing should follow
as a logical and legitimate conclusion of
the preceding stages. It should be like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
result of a mathematical problem which has
been carefully worked out. Of course it is impossible
for any one Salesman to "sell them
all," from the very nature of things&mdash;but the
average man could sell a larger percentage of
prospects if he would strengthen himself along
the preliminary stages leading up to the Closing,
and to the final steps of the latter.</p>

<p>The gist of the whole matter of the failure
of a prospect to make a favorable Decision is
this: He hasn't been convinced! Why? If
you can answer this question, you have the
key to the problem. You haven't reached the
man's desire. Why? If you can get him to
"want" the thing, the decision is a mere
matter of final settling down to choice. You
may have said to the man, "This is a good
thing&mdash;you ought to have it," over and over
again&mdash;but have you actually made him see
that it was a good thing and that he ought to
have it? It is one thing to tell a man these
things, and another to reproduce your own beliefs
in his mind.</p>

<p>The changing of the talk from that affecting
Deliberation on the part of the prospect,
to that influencing his Decision, is a delicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
matter. There is a "psychological moment"
for the change which some men seem to perceive
intuitively, while others have to learn
it by hard experience. It is the critical balancing
point between "enough" and "too
much" talk.</p>

<p>On the one hand, the Salesman must beware
of a premature Closing, and on the other he
must avoid "unselling" a man after he has
made the psychological sale. Some men are
inclined toward one of these faults&mdash;and some
to the other. The ideal Salesman has found
the nice point of balance between the two.</p>

<p>If the Salesman attempts to make a premature
Closing, he will probably have failed to
bring about the full desire and careful Deliberation
in the prospect's mind. As a practical
writer on the subject has pointed out,
this course is as faulty as that of a lawyer
who would attempt to begin his closing address
to the jury before he had gotten in his
evidence. The trained finger on the pulse
should detect the "high-tide of interest," and
close the demonstration at this point, moving
surely and swiftly to the Closing.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the Salesman persists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
in talking on, rambling and wandering, after
he has made a particular point, or all of his
points, he runs the risk of losing his prospect's
attention and interest, and with it
the newly awakened inclination and desire.
James H. Collins, in a recent article in "The
Saturday Evening Post," relates the following
amusing anecdote illustrating this tendency
on the part of the Salesman:</p>

<p>"How easily a customer may be talked out
of buying is shown by the experience of a
real-estate promoter who sells New York
property to investors in other cities through
a staff of salesmen. One of his men reported
that he was unable to close an elderly German
in Pittsburg. 'I've explained the whole property,'
said the salesman. 'He understands the
possibilities, yet doesn't invest.' Next time
the promoter was in Pittsburg he called on
this investor, accompanied by his salesman.
The latter explained the proposition again
most exhaustively, and made every effort to be
clear and convincing. * * * From time
to time the investor tried to interrupt, but
the salesman swept on, saying: 'Just a moment,
and I'll take that point up with you.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
When the story was finished he recapitulated.
When that was finished he began a resume of
the recapitulation preparatory to rushing the
man. Here the boss felt that the investor
really wanted to be heard, so he interrupted
the salesman: 'Charlie, I guess if Mr. Conrad
here doesn't realize the magnificent opportunities
in New York realty after all
you've told him, there's no use telling him any
more.' 'Mein gracious!' protested Conrad.
'I do realize them. What I wanted to say is
that I will take these lots.'"</p>

<p>There is a sixth sense, or intuitive faculty
developed in many good salesmen which tends
to inform them when they have said enough
along any particular line, or on the whole subject.
In the midst of a sentence, or after the
close of a statement, one will notice a subtle
and indefinable change in the manner or expression
of the prospect which informs one
that it is time to stop, and "sum up," or
briefly recapitulate. And this "summing up"
must be made briefly, and to the point, in an
earnest manner. It should be made in a
logical order and sequence, each point being
driven in as with a sledge hammer of convic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>tion.
One should lay especial stress upon any
points in which the prospect seemed interested
during the Demonstration. In short he should
fall in with the spirit of the attorney in his
closing address, in which he sums up his
strong points, always with an eye on the jury
which he has carefully watched for signs of
interest during the progress of the trial. Each
juryman's character is represented by a
faculty in the mind of the prospect&mdash;each
should be appealed to along its own particular
lines.</p>

<p>The perception of the "psychological moment"
of closing the selling talk, is akin to
that of the lawyer who leads his jury up to a
dramatic and logical climax&mdash;and then stops.
Avoid creating an anti-climax. Mr. Collins
in the magazine article mentioned a moment
ago says: "The chief shortcoming of the
salesman who has difficulty in closing is,
usually, that he doesn't know when the psychological
moment has come to rush his man.
This is a very definite moment in every deal.
Veteran salesmen gauge it in various ways,
some by the attention their argument is receiving,
others by some sign in the customer's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
eyes, and others still by a sort of sixth sense
which seldom leads them wrong. * * * If
the mechanism of a representative sale could
be laid bare for study it would probably approximate
the mechanism of the universe in
that material theory by which the philosophers
explain the whole thing up to the point where
a slight push was necessary to set it going
eternally. The sale of the man who doesn't
close is technically complete except for the
push that lands the order. Sales may be made
by patient exposition of facts, building up the
case for the goods. But to close them, very
often, a real push or kick is needed. Logic
avails up to the moment when the customer
must be rushed."</p>

<p>The trouble with some prospects is that
they have practically made the Decision&mdash;but
do not know they have. That is, they have
accepted the premises of the argument; admitted
the logic of the succeeding argument
and demonstration; can see no escape from
the conclusion&mdash;but still they have not released
the spring of formal Decision which
settles the matter with a mental "click." It is
the Salesman's business to produce this men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>tal
"click." It is a process akin to "calling
the hand" of the opponent in a certain
game other than that of salesmanship. It is
the stage in which the matter is fairly and
squarely "put up" to the prospect. It is a
situation demanding nerve on the part of the
Salesman&mdash;that is apparent nerve, for it is
after all somewhat of a bluff on his part, for
although he wins if the prospect says "Yes,"
he does not necessarily lose if the answer be
"No!" for the Salesman, like the lover,
should never let one "No" discourage him.
"Never take 'No!' for an answer," says the
old song&mdash;and it is worth remembering by
the Salesman.</p>

<p>The "click" of Decision is often produced
by the Salesman "putting up" some strong
question or statement to the prospect, which,
in the popular term, "brings him to his feet."
As for instance the closing illustration of some
of the National Cash Register salesmen, who
after having demonstrated the merits of the
cash register by placing in it the "$7.16 of
real money," in two-dollar bills, one-dollar
bills, silver dollars, half-dollars, quarters,
dimes, nickles and pennies, during the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
points of the demonstration, turns suddenly
to the prospect and says to him: "Mr. Blank,
you have been watching every coin and bill I
have put into this cash drawer. Now how
much money do you think is in this drawer?"
Mr. Blank naturally doesn't know. Then the
Salesman proceeds: "Well, then, if you have
no conception of the amount of money in this
drawer, after watching me put every coin and
bill into it, far more closely than you could
possibly watch such transactions in your own
store, you must admit you are guessing every
night as to the amount that should be in your
cash drawer in your store." Pausing a moment
to let this strong point sink into the
prospect's mind, the Salesman then says,
earnestly and impressively: "<i>Mr. Blank,
don't you think you ought to have a register
of this kind?</i>" Every proposition contains
features similar to the one noted above, which
can be used effectively in bringing about the
"click" of decision.</p>

<p>In some cases the Suggestion of Imitation
may be employed at this stage by showing
orders from others, provided they are of importance.
Some men do not like this, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
the majority are influenced by the example of
others and the imitative suggestion prevails
and brings down the scale of Decision. In
some other cases the Salesman has found it
advantageous to drop into a serious, earnest
tone, manifesting a spirit akin to that of the
earnest worker at a revival meeting, and laying
his hand on the prospect's arm, impress
upon him the urgent need of his doing this
thing for his own good. With some prospects
this plan of placing the hand upon him in a
brotherly spirit, and looking him earnestly in
the eye, results in the final warming up of
conviction and decision&mdash;probably from the
associated suggestion of previous solemn exhortations
and friendly counsel. But other
men resent any such familiarity&mdash;one must
know human nature in using this method.</p>

<p>Never attempt to close your sale in the presence
of outsiders. Always defer it until the
prospect is alone, and you have his undivided
attention. It is impossible to get into the
"heart to heart" rapport in the presence of
other people.</p>

<p>You may sometimes bring about the Decision
by asking pointed and appropriate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
questions, the answer of which must act to
clinch the matter. But in asking these questions
always be careful not to ask a question
which may easily be answered by a "No."
Never say: "Won't you buy?" or "Can't I
sell you?" These questions, and others like
them give the suggestion of a negative answer&mdash;they
make it too easy for the prospect
to say "No." Remember what we have said
elsewhere regarding the suggestions of questions.
Remember the horrible example of
"You don't want to buy anything to-day, do
you?" And also remember that a question
preceded by an affirmative statement, tends to
draw forth an affirmative answer. As, for instance:
"That is a nice day, isn't it;" or,
"This is a beautiful shade of pink, isn't it?;"
or, "This is quite an improvement, isn't it?"
In asking the important question, do not show
any doubt in your tone, manner or form of
expression. Beware, always, of making a
negative mental track for your prospect to
travel over. The mind works along the lines
of least resistance&mdash;be sure you make that
"line" in the right direction.</p>

<p>In cases where you have been recommended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
to call upon a person by a friend with whom
he has discussed the proposition, you may
often find that but little preliminary talk is
needed, and you may proceed to the Closing
very shortly after opening the conversation.
In these cases, the prospect often has "closed
himself" without your aid&mdash;he wants the
thing without urging. When you meet this
condition, take things for granted, and make
the sale just as you would if the prospect had
called upon you to make the purchase. And
in any and every case, if you see that the prospect
has "closed himself," clinch the matter
at once. And you can readily see when this
stage has arrived. After all, the process of
discovering the "psychological moment" of
Closing is like the intuitive discovery of the
psychological moment for "popping the question"
in courting. At certain times in courting
these psychological moments arise&mdash;then
is the time to "close." And the same rule
holds good in Salesmanship. It is largely
a matter of feeling, after all.</p>

<p>And, in Salesmanship, as in courting, remember
also that "Faint Heart never won
Fair Lady." Fortune favors the brave.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
When you feel the psychological urge of the
moment&mdash;step in! Don't be afraid. Remember
the old couplet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse quote">"Tender-handed grasp a nettle, and it stings you for your pains.</div>
   <div class="verse">Grasp it like a man of mettle, and it soft as down remains."</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>When it comes to the psychological moment,
banish fear from your mind. Show spirit and
be "game." You have got to make the plunge,
and take the risk of "the proposal" some time&mdash;why
not now? You have done your best,
then go ahead. Stand up and take your
chance like a man. But never act as if there
is any chance about it&mdash;preserve your mental
attitude of confident expectation, for these
mental states are contagious.</p>

<p>If, in spite of everything, the Decision be
against you, do not be discouraged. If you
think you can reverse the decision by a little
further persuasion, do so by all means. Many
a battle is won, after it has apparently been
lost. Few maidens expect their gallant laddies
to accept the first "No" as conclusive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>&mdash;and
the minds of many buyers work in the
same way. There is a certain coyness about
maids, <i>and prospects</i>, which seems to call for
a little further coaxing. Many prospects yield
only at the final appeal&mdash;they are like Byron's
heroine who "saying she would ne'er consent,
consented."</p>

<p>But if the "No" is final, take it good-naturedly,
and without show of resentment, and
assuming an "I will call again another day"
spirit, bid the prospect good-bye, courteously,
and take your departure. Many subsequent
sales have been made in this way&mdash;and many
have been lost by a show of ill-nature. The
average man likes a game fighter, and respects
a "good loser." Don't give up at anything
short of a "knock-out," but, that given, shake
hands with the victor good-naturedly, and
then proceed to lay plans for another interview.
Good nature and cheerfulness under
defeat never fail to make friends, and to disarm
enemies.</p>

<p>As we have said in a previous chapter, there
is sometimes a hitch between Decision and
Action. The spirit of procrastination creeps
in, and the prospect tries to put off the actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
order. Try to overcome this by "taking
down" the order at once. Do not allow any
wait at this stage. If no signed order is necessary
get the order down in your order book as
quickly as possible. Have your order book
handy so that no awkward wait arises. Avoid
these intervals of waiting as far as possible.
Get through with the thing, and get out.</p>

<p>If a signed order is required, approach the
request as a matter of course. Do not assume
the air of asking any further favor, or of
needing any argument regarding the signing.
Treat it as a matter of course, and as if the
matter had been agreed upon. Do not say "I
will have to ask you to sign," etc., but say
simply "sign here, please," placing your
fountain pen at the "suggestive slant," and
in his direction, indicating the line at the same
time. Some salesmen even touch the pen to
the line, starting the ink flowing and the suggestion
operating with the one movement.
Others proceed, calmly, like this: "Let's see,
Mr. Blank, what is your shipping address
(or street number)?" adding, "We can have
these goods here by about such-and-such a
date." And while he is saying this they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
filling up the order blank. Then, in the most
matter of fact, business-like manner they lay
the order before the prospect, indicating the
line for signature, and saying: "Now, if you
will kindly sign here, please, Mr. Blank."
And it is all over.</p>

<p>Always have the order blank, or book, and
the fountain pen handy. Avoid fiddling
around after the pen or the book, or both&mdash;this
is suggestive in the wrong direction.
Some salesmen lay the pen on top of the order
book, and place them easily before the prospect
while talking. Others lay the pen by the
side of the book, in the same way. Collins
says: "One of the leading newspapers in the
Middle West has a school for the canvassers
who solicit subscriptions. A set of books is
sold in connection with a year's subscription
to this paper, and the solicitors are drilled in
old fashioned bookselling tactics, learning
their argument by rote. At the precise point
where the signature of the prospect is to be
secured the salesman is taught to take his
pencil from his pocket, drop it on the floor
apparently by accident, stoop over and pick it
up as he finishes his argument, and put it into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
the prospect's fingers as a matter of course.
Six times in ten the signature is written without
more argument." The psychological
point employed here is evidently that of distracting
the prospect's mind from his ordinary
objection, and attracting his attention
to the recovered pencil. A similar proceeding
is that followed by certain salesmen who carry
a large fountain pen with a rubber band
wrapped around the handle. Talking cheerfully,
they drop the pen on the prospect's
desk, close to his hand. The rubber band
makes it fall noiselessly, and prevents it from
rolling. The prospect is said usually to involuntarily
pick up the pen, and move it toward
the order book which has been deftly
placed before him, and, then, still absorbed in
the talk of the Salesman, he signs the order
blank. These methods are given for what
they are worth, and in the way of illustrating
a psychological principle. Personally, we do
not favor these methods, and prefer the orthodox
fountain pen, courteously handed the
prospect, at the "suggestive slant," with possibly
the point touching the line as an illustra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>tion
of the "on this line, please," which accompanies
it.</p>

<p>The principle to be observed in all cases
where orders have to be signed, receipts made
out, etc., is to make the process as easy as
possible for the prospect. Let him work along
the line of the least resistance. Avoid giving
him the adverse suggestion of "red tape,"
formality, "iron-clad contracts," etc. Act
upon the principle of the young man who when
he asked his father for money would say it
very smoothly and <i>rapidly</i> "twenty dollars
please," as if it were twenty cents. Smooth
away every item of delay and friction, and
adopt the "rubber tire and ball bearings"
mental attitude and mode of procedure.</p>

<p>Regarding the much disputed and vexing
question of the interval between Decision and
Action, and the frequent failure of Decision
to take form in Action&mdash;which question, by the
way, is very important in the Closing of the
Salesman&mdash;we ask you to read the following
from the pen of Prof. William James, the
eminent psychologist:</p>

<p>"We know what it is to get out of bed on a
freezing morning in a room without a fire, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
how the very vital principle within us protests
against the ordeal. Probably most persons
have lain on certain mornings for an hour
at a time unable to brace themselves to the resolve.
We think how late we shall be, how
the duties of the day will suffer; we say, 'I
<i>must</i> get up, this is ignominious,' etc.; but
still the warm couch feels too delicious, the
cold outside too cruel, and resolution faints
away and postpones itself again and again
just as it seemed on the verge of bursting the
resistance and passing over into the decisive
act. Now how do we <i>ever</i> get up under such
circumstances? If I may generalize from my
own experience, we more often than not get
up without any struggle or decision at all.
We suddenly find that we <i>have</i> to get up. A
fortunate lapse of consciousness occurs; we
forget both the warmth and the cold; we fall
into some reverie connected with the day's life,
in the course of which the idea flashes across
us, 'Hello! I must lie here no longer'&mdash;an idea
which at that lucky instant awakens no contradictory
or paralyzing suggestions, and consequently
produces immediately its appropriate
motor effects. It was our acute con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>sciousness
of both the warmth and cold during
the period of struggle, which paralyzed
our activity then and kept our idea of rising
in the condition of <i>wish</i> and not of <i>will</i>. The
moment these inhibitory ideas ceased, the
original idea exerted its effects. This case
seems to me to contain in miniature form the
data for an entire psychology of volition."</p>

<p>Prof. James, in another place, gives the
following additional hint of the process of
transmuting the Decision into Action: "Let
us call the last idea which in the mind precedes
the motor discharge, 'the motor-cue' * * *
There can be no doubt whatever that the
cue may be an image either of the resident or
the remote kind."</p>

<p>It will be seen then that the "motor cue"
which releases the spring of Action&mdash;the mental
trigger which fires the gun of will&mdash;may
easily be some remote idea <i>suggested</i> to the
mind, as for instance the sight of the slanted
fountain pen and order book. The man wants
to, but does not feel like getting out of bed,
and his mind becomes inactive on the question.
If some friend had said to him, "Come, get
out old fellow;" or if he had had his mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
suddenly attracted by some outside sound or
sight, he would have sprung out at once. As
we have said, elsewhere, the placing of a piece
of twisted paper in the ear of a horse will
cause him to forget his balkiness&mdash;it changes
his current of thought. Any new impulse will
tend to get a man over his period of "I want
to but I don't" mental hesitancy. We may
have given you the psychology of the thing
here&mdash;you must work it out in the details of application
to suit your own requirements. Learn
to show your prospect something that will
cause him to spring out of bed. Learn to stick
the piece of twisted paper in his ear, to overcome
his balkiness. Give him the "motor
cue" by supplying him with a mental image
"either of the resident or remote kind." Like
the boy shivering on the brink of the stream,
he needs but a "little shove" to make him take
the plunge. Then he will call to others:
"Come on in, the water's fine."</p>

<p>And, now in conclusion: You have the
signed order, but you must continue your
Mental Attitude until you fade from the prospect's
sight. Do not gush or become maudlin,
as we have seen salesmen do. Maintain your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
balance, and thank your customer courteously,
but not as the recipient of alms. Keep up his
good impression of and respect for you to
the last. Leave the prospect with this thought
radiating from your mind: "I have done this
man a good turn." The prospect will catch
these subtle vibrations, in some way not worth
discussing, and he too will feel that he has
done well. Avoid the "Well, I landed this
chap, all right, all right!" mental attitude,
which shows so plainly in the manner of some
salesmen after they have booked an order.
The prospect will catch those vibrations also,
and will not like it&mdash;he will resent it, naturally.
In short, you would do well to follow the
homely but scientific advice of the old salesman
who said: "Keep your sugar-coating on
to the last&mdash;leave 'em with a pleasant taste
in their mouths." Make a good Last Impression
as well as a good First Impression.</p>

<p>But&mdash;and remember this also&mdash;get away
when your work is over. Do not hang around
the office or store of the prospect after the sale
is made. Do not place yourself in a position
where some newly discovered objection will
cause you to do your work all over again. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
have got what you came for&mdash;now get out!
As Macbain says: "When the close is made
the customer should be left in the shortest possible
time that may not be characterized as
abrupt. Having 'talked a man into a sale,'
the salesman should be careful not to talk him
out. The old adage, 'Stop praising the goods
after the sale is made,' is as true as it is trite."
Collins very aptly says on this point: "The
explainer type of salesman may actually sell
goods to a customer and then, by staying and
talking, unsell him without knowing it.
* * * One afternoon not long ago, for instance,
a salesman sold eleven thousand dollars'
worth of fabrics to a prominent merchant
and, by staying for a friendly chat after the
order had been secured, gave the merchant
time to think twice and cancel it. An excellent
rule is that of a salesman who built up a
business to a quarter million in competition
with wealthy competitors, doing this by sheer
selling ability. 'Take the first train out of
town after you sell your man,' was his rule.
If there was no train for several hours he excused
himself the moment a deal was closed,
and disappeared. 'Just as sure as I stayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
around after that order was in my pocket,' he
says, 'part of it would be cancelled or modified
by the buyer, or some of my work in selling
undone. If it were nothing else the buyer
would play on the fact that I felt good about
getting that order, and squeeze something
extra out of me.' When you land your man
get out of sight."</p>

<p>And, taking our own advice, kind reader,
we, having said our say and "closed," will
now take our departure. We thank you for
your kind attention, and feel that we "have
done you a good turn."</p>
